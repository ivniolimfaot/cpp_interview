### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): The Greedy Method

The Greedy Method is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm used in solving optimization problems. It works by making a series of choices, each time selecting the best option available at the moment, without considering the global optimal solution. The hope is that by consistently making locally optimal choices, the algorithm will eventually reach a globally optimal solution.

Here's a basic outline of how the Greedy Method works:

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly define the problem and the criteria for optimization.

2. **Identify Greedy Choices**: Determine the choices that seem to be the best at each step. This is usually based on some heuristic or rule.

3. **Greedy Choice Property**: Prove that making the greedy choice at each step leads to an optimal solution for the whole problem.

4. **Construct the Solution**: Use a loop or recursion to implement the greedy strategy and construct the final solution.

5. **Optimization Criteria**: Ensure that the chosen greedy criteria actually lead to an optimal solution.

6. **Proof of Correctness**: Provide a formal proof or argument that the Greedy Method indeed produces the optimal solution.

7. **Implement and Analyze**: Implement the algorithm and analyze its time complexity to ensure it meets the efficiency requirements.

Common examples of problems solved using the Greedy Method include:

- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Finding the minimum-weight connected subgraph that connects all vertices in a graph.
- **Shortest Path**: Finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.
- **Interval Scheduling**: Scheduling tasks with start and finish times to maximize the number of tasks that can be completed.
- **Huffman Coding**: Constructing a variable-length prefix coding scheme to minimize the average encoding length of symbols.

It's important to note that while the Greedy Method is powerful and often efficient, it doesn't always guarantee an optimal solution. Therefore, it's crucial to verify that the greedy approach works for the specific problem being solved. In some cases, a greedy algorithm may produce a suboptimal solution, but still be acceptable depending on the problem constraints and requirements.


### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is Greedy Algorithm?

A Greedy Algorithm is an approach to problem-solving in computer science and mathematics where the solution is built step by step in a way that seems most beneficial at each step, without reconsidering previous choices. At each step, the algorithm selects the best available option, usually the one that maximizes some criteria or minimizes some cost, with the hope that this will lead to an optimal solution overall.

One characteristic of greedy algorithms is that they do not necessarily guarantee an optimal solution in all cases, but they often provide a good approximation solution that is close to optimal.

Common examples of problems solved using greedy algorithms include finding the shortest path in graph theory (Dijkstra's algorithm), finding the minimum spanning tree in a graph (Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm), and the knapsack problem.

In C++, a Greedy Algorithm is implemented by selecting the best available option iteratively in a loop until the solution is found or the algorithm terminates.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Set

Disjoint Set, also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides two main operations:

1. **Union:** Merge two subsets into a single subset.
2. **Find:** Determine which subset a particular element is in. This operation can be used for checking whether two elements are in the same subset.

Here's a basic implementation of Disjoint Set in C++ using both the union by rank and path compression techniques:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class DisjointSet {
private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        // Initially, each element is its own parent (representing a single-element set)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    // Find operation with path compression
    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x]) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union operation with union by rank
    void Union(int x, int y) {
        int xRoot = find(x);
        int yRoot = find(y);

        if (xRoot == yRoot) return;

        if (rank[xRoot] < rank[yRoot]) {
            parent[xRoot] = yRoot;
        } else if (rank[xRoot] > rank[yRoot]) {
            parent[yRoot] = xRoot;
        } else {
            parent[yRoot] = xRoot;
            rank[xRoot]++;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of elements
    DisjointSet ds(n);

    // Example usage
    ds.Union(0, 1);
    ds.Union(2, 3);
    ds.Union(0, 4);

    std::cout << "Are 1 and 4 in the same set? " << (ds.find(1) == ds.find(4) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Are 2 and 4 in the same set? " << (ds.find(2) == ds.find(4) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses the "union by rank" heuristic for merging subsets and "path compression" technique for speeding up the find operation by making the found root of the representative elements point directly to the root. These optimizations ensure efficient time complexities for both operations, leading to nearly constant time for each operation on average.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Set for Cycle Detection

In C++, you can implement a Disjoint Set data structure to detect cycles efficiently. Disjoint Set is commonly used in conjunction with other algorithms, such as Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and cycle detection. Here's a basic implementation of Disjoint Set along with cycle detection using union-find:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class DisjointSet {
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        // Initialize each element as its own parent
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    // Find the parent of the set containing element x
    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x])
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union the sets containing elements x and y
    void unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY])
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            else if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY])
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

bool hasCycle(vector<pair<int, int>>& edges, int n) {
    DisjointSet ds(n);

    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge.first;
        int v = edge.second;

        int parentU = ds.find(u);
        int parentV = ds.find(v);

        // If both vertices are in the same set, a cycle is detected
        if (parentU == parentV)
            return true;

        // Otherwise, union the sets of the two vertices
        ds.unionSets(parentU, parentV);
    }

    return false;
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // Number of vertices
    vector<pair<int, int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 0}}; // Example edges

    if (hasCycle(edges, n))
        cout << "Graph contains a cycle.\n";
    else
        cout << "Graph doesn't contain a cycle.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we create a `DisjointSet` class which allows us to perform operations like finding the parent of an element and unioning two sets. The `hasCycle` function takes a vector of edges and the number of vertices as input, then iterates over each edge, checking if its endpoints belong to the same set. If they do, a cycle is detected; otherwise, the sets are unioned. Finally, the main function demonstrates how to use this implementation by creating an example graph and checking for cycles.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Set in C++

A disjoint set (also known as a union-find data structure) is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. Here's an implementation of a disjoint set in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class DisjointSet {
private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    void union_sets(int x, int y) {
        int root_x = find(x);
        int root_y = find(y);
        if (root_x != root_y) {
            if (rank[root_x] < rank[root_y])
                std::swap(root_x, root_y);
            parent[root_y] = root_x;
            if (rank[root_x] == rank[root_y])
                rank[root_x]++;
        }
    }
};
```

This implementation uses both the path compression and union by rank optimizations to ensure efficient operations. Path compression optimizes the `find` operation by making each node point directly to the root of its set, reducing the time complexity of subsequent finds. Union by rank optimizes the `union_sets` operation by always attaching the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree, which helps keep the tree balanced and ensures logarithmic time complexity for the operation.

Here's how you can use the `DisjointSet` class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n = 5; // number of elements
    DisjointSet ds(n);

    ds.union_sets(0, 2);
    ds.union_sets(1, 3);
    ds.union_sets(2, 4);

    std::cout << "Parent of 0: " << ds.find(0) << std::endl; // Should print 2
    std::cout << "Parent of 1: " << ds.find(1) << std::endl; // Should print 3
    std::cout << "Parent of 2: " << ds.find(2) << std::endl; // Should print 2
    std::cout << "Parent of 3: " << ds.find(3) << std::endl; // Should print 3
    std::cout << "Parent of 4: " << ds.find(4) << std::endl; // Should print 2

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates how to create a disjoint set with 5 elements and perform union operations between them, followed by finding their parent elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Set Union

Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, is a data structure and algorithm used to efficiently solve problems involving disjoint sets. It maintains a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets and supports two main operations:

1. **Union**: Merge two sets into one.
2. **Find**: Determine which set a particular element belongs to.

Here's a basic implementation of DSU in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class DisjointSet {
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n);
        // Initially, each element is its own parent and has rank 0
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x]) {
            // Path compression: make the parent of x point to the root of its set
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            // Union by rank: attach the smaller rank tree under the root of the higher rank tree
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    DisjointSet dsu(5); // Create a disjoint set with 5 elements

    dsu.unionSets(0, 2);
    dsu.unionSets(1, 4);
    dsu.unionSets(3, 2);

    // Output: 2
    cout << "Parent of 3: " << dsu.find(3) << endl;
    
    // Output: 4
    cout << "Parent of 1: " << dsu.find(1) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation utilizes both path compression and union by rank optimizations to achieve efficient performance. Path compression ensures that the find operation runs in nearly constant time, and union by rank ensures that the depth of the trees remains small, resulting in efficient union operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Set Union Data Structure

The Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, also known as the Union-Find data structure, is a data structure that keeps track of a collection of disjoint sets, where each set is represented by one of its members. It provides two main operations: **union**, which merges two sets together, and **find**, which determines which set a particular element belongs to.

Here's a simple implementation of the DSU data structure in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class DSU {
private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;

public:
    DSU(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 1);  // Initialize rank of each element as 1
        // Initially, each element is its own parent
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    // Find operation: returns the representative of the set containing x
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);  // Path compression
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union operation: merges the sets containing x and y
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            // Union by rank
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY])
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            else if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY])
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- The `parent` vector holds the parent of each element. Initially, each element is its own parent, representing a singleton set.
- The `rank` vector holds the rank of each element. Rank is used to keep the tree balanced during union operations.
- The `find` function recursively finds the representative of the set containing a given element `x`, while performing path compression to optimize future queries.
- The `unite` function merges the sets containing elements `x` and `y`. It uses the ranks of the sets to decide which one becomes the parent during the union operation, which helps in keeping the tree balanced.

This DSU implementation has an almost constant time complexity for both `find` and `unite` operations, making it very efficient for a wide range of applications, such as Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees and detecting cycles in a graph.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Sets and Kruskal's Algorithm

Sure! Disjoint Sets and Kruskal's Algorithm are both fundamental concepts in the field of algorithms and data structures, especially in the context of graph theory and spanning tree algorithms. Let me break down each concept:

#### Disjoint Sets

Disjoint Sets, also known as Union-Find or Merge-Find data structure, is used to maintain a collection of disjoint sets and efficiently perform operations like finding which set an element belongs to, merging two sets, and determining whether two elements belong to the same set. It's commonly used in algorithms like Kruskal's Algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees.

In C++, Disjoint Sets can be implemented using either the array-based approach or the tree-based approach (also known as union by rank and path compression). Here's a basic implementation of the array-based approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class DisjointSets {
private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSets(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
        return parent[x];
    }

    void merge(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY])
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            else if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY])
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It operates by adding edges in increasing order of their weights while avoiding the formation of cycles. Here's how it works:

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Initialize an empty graph to store the minimum spanning tree.
3. Iterate through the sorted edges and add each edge to the minimum spanning tree if it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already added.

Here's a basic implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm using Disjoint Sets:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Edge {
    int src, dest, weight;
};

class Graph {
private:
    int V;
    std::vector<Edge> edges;

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V) {}

    void addEdge(int src, int dest, int weight) {
        edges.push_back({src, dest, weight});
    }

    std::vector<Edge> kruskalMST() {
        std::vector<Edge> result;
        DisjointSets ds(V);

        // Sort edges by weight
        std::sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const Edge& a, const Edge& b) {
            return a.weight < b.weight;
        });

        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int rootSrc = ds.find(edge.src);
            int rootDest = ds.find(edge.dest);

            if (rootSrc != rootDest) {
                result.push_back(edge);
                ds.merge(rootSrc, rootDest);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

These are basic implementations and can be optimized further based on specific requirements and constraints.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Disjoint Subsets

Disjoint Set or Union-Find data structure is used to efficiently perform operations on disjoint sets. It has two main operations: merging sets and finding the representative element of a set. Below is a C++ implementation of Disjoint Set using both the union by rank and path compression optimizations, which ensures efficient performance.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class DisjointSet {
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;

public:
    DisjointSet(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        // Initially, each element is its own parent
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    // Find operation with path compression
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union operation by rank
    void merge(int x, int y) {
        int xRoot = find(x);
        int yRoot = find(y);

        // If x and y are already in the same set
        if (xRoot == yRoot)
            return;

        // Attach smaller rank tree under root of higher rank tree
        if (rank[xRoot] < rank[yRoot])
            parent[xRoot] = yRoot;
        else if (rank[xRoot] > rank[yRoot])
            parent[yRoot] = xRoot;
        else {
            // If ranks are the same, make one as root and increment its rank by one
            parent[yRoot] = xRoot;
            rank[xRoot]++;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of elements
    DisjointSet ds(n);

    // Example usage
    ds.merge(0, 2);
    ds.merge(4, 2);
    ds.merge(3, 1);

    // Check if elements are in the same set
    cout << "Are 0 and 4 in the same set? " << (ds.find(0) == ds.find(4) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Are 1 and 3 in the same set? " << (ds.find(1) == ds.find(3) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation has a time complexity of approximately O(log n) for both find and merge operations, where n is the number of elements. This efficiency is achieved due to the path compression and union by rank optimizations.

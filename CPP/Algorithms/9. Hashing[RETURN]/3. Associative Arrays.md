### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Associative Arrays

Associative arrays, also known as maps or dictionaries in other programming languages, are fundamental data structures that store key-value pairs. In C++, the `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` containers from the Standard Template Library (STL) are commonly used to implement associative arrays.

1. **std::map**: It's an associative container that stores elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value. The keys in a map are always sorted following a specific strict weak ordering criterion.

    Example:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <map>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        // Declare a map with int keys and string values
        map<int, string> studentMap;

        // Inserting elements into the map
        studentMap[1001] = "Alice";
        studentMap[1002] = "Bob";
        studentMap[1003] = "Charlie";

        // Accessing elements using keys
        cout << "Name of student with ID 1002: " << studentMap[1002] << endl;

        return 0;
    }
    ```

2. **std::unordered_map**: It's an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. The keys in an unordered map are not sorted, and the elements are organized based on the hash value of the keys.

    Example:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <unordered_map>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        // Declare an unordered_map with string keys and int values
        unordered_map<string, int> inventory;

        // Inserting elements into the unordered_map
        inventory["apple"] = 10;
        inventory["banana"] = 20;
        inventory["orange"] = 15;

        // Accessing elements using keys
        cout << "Number of apples in inventory: " << inventory["apple"] << endl;

        return 0;
    }
    ```

Associative arrays are useful for various applications like storing mappings between unique identifiers and values, implementing symbol tables, or solving problems where you need fast lookup based on keys. Depending on the requirements of your program, you can choose between `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` based on factors like performance, memory usage, and whether the order of elements matters.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Associative Arrays (HashTables)

Associative arrays, also known as hash tables or hash maps, are fundamental data structures in computer science used to store key-value pairs. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, typically with an average time complexity of O(1) for each of these operations (assuming a good hash function and proper handling of collisions).

In C++, the `std::unordered_map` container from the Standard Template Library (STL) provides an implementation of hash tables. Here's a basic overview of how to use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Define an unordered_map with string keys and int values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting values into the map
    myMap["apple"] = 10;
    myMap["banana"] = 20;
    myMap["orange"] = 15;

    // Accessing values
    std::cout << "Number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Modifying values
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    std::cout << "Updated number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Checking if a key exists
    if (myMap.find("banana") != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Banana found! Quantity: " << myMap["banana"] << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterating through the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << " => " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We include the necessary headers for using `std::unordered_map`.
- We define an `unordered_map` called `myMap`, which maps strings to integers.
- We insert key-value pairs using the square bracket syntax (`[]`).
- We access and modify values using keys.
- We use the `find` function to check if a key exists.
- We iterate through the map using a range-based for loop.

Hash tables are extremely versatile and can be used in various scenarios such as caching, indexing, and implementing associative arrays. However, it's essential to choose a good hash function and handle collisions efficiently to maintain their performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structures: Hash Tables

#### Hash Tables in C++

Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are a type of data structure used to store key-value pairs. They provide efficient data retrieval by using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

##### Key Concepts

1. **Hash Function**:
   - Converts a key into an index in the hash table.
   - Should distribute keys uniformly across the table to minimize collisions.

2. **Collisions**:
   - Occur when two keys hash to the same index.
   - Handled using methods like chaining or open addressing.

3. **Load Factor**:
   - Ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets.
   - High load factor can degrade performance, so tables often resize when they reach a certain threshold.

##### Hash Table Operations

1. **Insert**:
   - Calculate the index using the hash function.
   - Add the key-value pair at the calculated index.
   - Handle collisions if necessary.

2. **Search**:
   - Calculate the index using the hash function.
   - Check the corresponding bucket for the key.
   - If found, return the value; otherwise, return a failure indication.

3. **Delete**:
   - Calculate the index using the hash function.
   - Find the key in the corresponding bucket.
   - Remove the key-value pair if found.

##### Implementation in C++

Let's walk through a basic implementation of a hash table using chaining for collision resolution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// A simple hash table implementation using chaining
class HashTable {
private:
    // Array of lists to handle collisions (chaining)
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<int, std::string>>> table;
    int capacity;
    int size;

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % capacity;
    }

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the hash table with a given capacity
    HashTable(int capacity) {
        this->capacity = capacity;
        table.resize(capacity);
        size = 0;
    }

    // Insert a key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(int key, const std::string &value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
        size++;
    }

    // Search for a value by key
    std::string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (const auto &pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return pair.second;
            }
        }
        return "Key not found";
    }

    // Delete a key-value pair from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        auto &pairs = table[index];
        for (auto it = pairs.begin(); it != pairs.end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                pairs.erase(it);
                size--;
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Display the contents of the hash table
    void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
            std::cout << "Bucket " << i << ": ";
            for (const auto &pair : table[i]) {
                std::cout << "(" << pair.first << ", " << pair.second << ") ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht(10);

    ht.insert(1, "One");
    ht.insert(2, "Two");
    ht.insert(12, "Twelve");
    ht.insert(22, "Twenty-two");

    ht.display();

    std::cout << "Search key 2: " << ht.search(2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Search key 3: " << ht.search(3) << std::endl;

    ht.remove(12);
    ht.display();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Hash Function**:
   - The `hashFunction` method computes the index for a given key by taking the modulus with the table's capacity.

2. **Insert Operation**:
   - The `insert` method uses the hash function to find the appropriate bucket and then adds the key-value pair to that bucket.

3. **Search Operation**:
   - The `search` method looks for the key in the appropriate bucket and returns the associated value if found.

4. **Delete Operation**:
   - The `remove` method searches for the key in the appropriate bucket and deletes it if found.

5. **Display Method**:
   - The `display` method prints the contents of the hash table, showing each bucket's contents.

This implementation demonstrates the basic principles of hash tables, including insertion, searching, deletion, and collision handling using chaining.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Advantage of Hash Table

Hash tables offer several advantages in comparison to other data structures, especially when implemented properly:

1. **Fast Lookup Time**: Hash tables provide constant-time average case complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, making them highly efficient for large datasets. This constant-time performance assumes that the hash function distributes the keys uniformly across the table, which is typically achievable with a good hash function.

2. **Flexible Key Types**: Hash tables can accommodate various types of keys, including integers, strings, and custom objects, as long as a hash function is defined for the key type. This flexibility allows for efficient storage and retrieval of diverse data types.

3. **Dynamic Sizing**: Hash tables can dynamically resize themselves to maintain a good balance between performance and memory usage. As the number of elements stored in the hash table increases, it can automatically resize to allocate more memory and rehash existing elements, ensuring that the load factor remains within an acceptable range.

4. **Collision Handling**: Hash tables can handle collisions efficiently through various collision resolution techniques such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store multiple elements with the same hash value) or open addressing (probing the table for an alternative slot to place the colliding element). With proper collision resolution strategies, hash tables can maintain high performance even in the presence of collisions.

5. **Space Efficiency**: Hash tables can achieve a good balance between space and time complexity. While they may consume more memory than other data structures due to potential collisions and the need for a certain amount of unused space (to maintain performance guarantees), they generally offer efficient memory usage for large datasets.

6. **Widely Used in Practice**: Hash tables are widely used in practice due to their efficiency and versatility. They serve as the underlying data structure for many important applications, including database indexing, caching mechanisms, symbol tables in compilers, and associative arrays in programming languages.

Overall, hash tables are a powerful tool for implementing fast and scalable data storage and retrieval systems, especially when the key-value pairs are unordered and the primary concern is efficient lookup.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Bucket Array & Hash Function

Certainly! A bucket array, often used in conjunction with a hash function, is a data structure commonly employed in hash tables. Let's break down these components:

#### Bucket Array

A bucket array is an array where each element (bucket) can hold multiple values. These values are typically stored in a linked list or another dynamic data structure to accommodate collisions (when multiple keys hash to the same index). Each element of the bucket array corresponds to a "bucket" or a slot where elements with similar hash values are stored.

In C++, you might implement a bucket array using `std::vector` or a custom dynamic array implementation, with each element containing a data structure to handle collisions, such as a linked list or an array of key-value pairs.

#### Hash Function

A hash function is a function that converts an input (or a key) into a numeric value, typically of fixed size. The output of a hash function is called a hash code or hash value. The primary purpose of a hash function is to map data of arbitrary size to data of a fixed size, which is usually a non-negative integer.

The hash function should ideally distribute keys uniformly across the range of hash values to minimize collisions. Common hash functions include division method, multiplication method, and various cryptographic hash functions.

In C++, you might define a hash function as a separate function or as part of a hash table class. For example:

```cpp
size_t hashFunction(const std::string& key) {
    size_t hash = 0;
    for (char c : key) {
        hash = hash * 31 + c; // A simple hash function, where 31 is a prime number
    }
    return hash;
}
```

#### Putting it Together

Here's a simple example of how you might combine a bucket array with a hash function in a hash table implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <string>

class HashTable {
private:
    static const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<std::string, int>>> table;

    size_t hashFunction(const std::string& key) {
        size_t hash = 0;
        for (char c : key) {
            hash = hash * 31 + c;
        }
        return hash % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    HashTable() : table(TABLE_SIZE) {}

    void insert(const std::string& key, int value) {
        size_t index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back({key, value});
    }

    int get(const std::string& key) {
        size_t index = hashFunction(key);
        for (const auto& kvp : table[index]) {
            if (kvp.first == key) {
                return kvp.second;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Not found
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert("apple", 5);
    ht.insert("banana", 7);
    ht.insert("orange", 3);

    std::cout << "Value for 'apple': " << ht.get("apple") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value for 'banana': " << ht.get("banana") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value for 'orange': " << ht.get("orange") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `HashTable` is a simple hash table implementation using a bucket array. The `insert` function inserts key-value pairs into the hash table, and the `get` function retrieves the value associated with a given key. The `hashFunction` is used to determine the index in the bucket array where each key-value pair should be stored or retrieved from.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Chaining - Collision Detection Scheme

Chaining is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables to handle collisions. When two different keys hash to the same index, instead of overwriting the existing value, chaining allows multiple values (or key-value pairs) to be stored at the same index, forming a linked list or other structure.

Here's how chaining works in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <utility> // for std::pair

class HashTable {
private:
    // Define the size of the hash table
    static const int tableSize = 10;

    // Define the structure to hold key-value pairs
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<int, std::string>>> table;

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % tableSize;
    }

public:
    HashTable() {
        // Initialize the hash table with empty lists
        table.resize(tableSize);
    }

    // Function to insert key-value pairs into the hash table
    void insert(int key, const std::string& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }

    // Function to search for a value given a key
    std::string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        // Traverse the linked list at the hashed index
        for (const auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return pair.second; // Return the value associated with the key
            }
        }
        return "Key not found";
    }

    // Function to remove a key-value pair from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        // Traverse the linked list at the hashed index
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                table[index].erase(it);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;

    // Insert key-value pairs
    ht.insert(10, "Alice");
    ht.insert(25, "Bob");
    ht.insert(20, "Charlie");

    // Search for values
    std::cout << "Value for key 10: " << ht.search(10) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value for key 25: " << ht.search(25) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value for key 20: " << ht.search(20) << std::endl;

    // Remove a key-value pair
    ht.remove(25);
    std::cout << "Value for key 25 after removal: " << ht.search(25) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `HashTable` class maintains a vector of lists, where each list represents a chain at a specific index of the hash table.
- The `insert()` function hashes the key, determines the index, and appends the key-value pair to the list at that index.
- The `search()` function hashes the key, traverses the list at the hashed index, and returns the value associated with the key if found.
- The `remove()` function hashes the key, traverses the list at the hashed index, and removes the key-value pair if found.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Double Hashing

Double hashing is a collision resolution technique used in hash tables, primarily to handle collisions that occur when two distinct keys map to the same index. Unlike linear probing or separate chaining, which deal with collisions by storing multiple items at the same index, double hashing calculates a second hash function to determine the next available slot to place the colliding item.

Here's a basic overview of how double hashing works:

1. **Hash Function**: Start with a primary hash function that maps keys to array indices. This function should produce a uniform distribution of hash values across the array.

2. **Collision Resolution**: If a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same index), instead of placing the colliding item directly into the array, calculate a second hash function to determine an alternative index.

3. **Double Hashing**: The second hash function, often referred to as the step size or increment function, generates a sequence of indices that the algorithm will probe until it finds an empty slot. The most common approach is to use another hash function that produces different values for different keys.

4. **Insertion**: When inserting an item, calculate its primary hash value. If the slot at that index is occupied, use the second hash function to find the next available slot and insert the item there. Repeat this process until an empty slot is found.

5. **Lookup and Deletion**: When looking up or deleting an item, calculate its primary hash value and probe the array using both the primary and secondary hash functions until the item is found or an empty slot is encountered.

Here's a simplified example of how double hashing might be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class DoubleHashing {
private:
    int capacity;
    std::vector<int> table;
    std::vector<bool> isOccupied;

    // Primary hash function
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % capacity;
    }

    // Secondary hash function (step size)
    int hash2(int key) {
        // Example secondary hash function: prime number smaller than the table size
        return 7 - (key % 7);
    }

public:
    DoubleHashing(int size) : capacity(size), table(size), isOccupied(size, false) {}

    // Insertion
    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int step = hash2(key);

        while (isOccupied[index]) {
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }

        table[index] = key;
        isOccupied[index] = true;
    }

    // Search
    bool search(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int step = hash2(key);

        while (isOccupied[index]) {
            if (table[index] == key)
                return true;
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }

        return false;
    }

    // Deletion
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int step = hash2(key);

        while (isOccupied[index]) {
            if (table[index] == key) {
                isOccupied[index] = false;
                return;
            }
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    DoubleHashing ht(10);
    ht.insert(5);
    ht.insert(15);
    ht.insert(25);

    std::cout << ht.search(5) << std::endl; // Output: 1 (true)
    std::cout << ht.search(10) << std::endl; // Output: 0 (false)

    ht.remove(15);
    std::cout << ht.search(15) << std::endl; // Output: 0 (false)

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `DoubleHashing` class implements a hash table using double hashing for collision resolution. The `insert`, `search`, and `remove` methods demonstrate how operations are performed using double hashing.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Extra: keys() Without Collision

If you're looking to implement a `keys()` function for a hash table in C++ without collision, you might be considering a perfect hash function. Perfect hashing is a technique where each key is directly mapped to a unique index in the hash table, eliminating collisions entirely.

Here's a high-level overview of how you could implement such a system:

1. **Choose a Perfect Hashing Algorithm**: There are different algorithms for generating perfect hash functions, such as the FKS algorithm, the CMPH library, or techniques like minimal perfect hashing.

2. **Generate the Hash Function**: Implement the algorithm chosen in step 1 to generate a perfect hash function for your set of keys. This function should map each key directly to a unique index in the hash table.

3. **Build the Hash Table**: Use the generated hash function to build the hash table. Ensure that it has the capacity to hold all your keys without any collisions.

4. **Implement the `keys()` Function**: This function should simply iterate over the hash table and collect all keys. Since there are no collisions, each slot in the hash table corresponds to exactly one key.

Here's a simple example of how you might implement these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

// A simple hash function that maps strings to unique indices
size_t perfectHash(const std::string& key) {
    // Your perfect hash function implementation goes here
    // This is just a placeholder
    return key.length() % 10;  // Modulo operation for simplicity
}

// A hash table with perfect hashing
class PerfectHashTable {
private:
    std::vector<std::string> table;

public:
    // Constructor that initializes the hash table
    PerfectHashTable(const std::vector<std::string>& keys) {
        table.resize(keys.size());
        for (const auto& key : keys) {
            size_t index = perfectHash(key);
            table[index] = key;
        }
    }

    // Function to get all keys in the hash table
    std::vector<std::string> keys() const {
        return table;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> keys = {"apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"};
    PerfectHashTable hashTable(keys);
    
    std::cout << "Keys in the hash table:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& key : hashTable.keys()) {
        std::cout << key << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This is a very basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to implement a more sophisticated perfect hashing algorithm to handle larger key sets efficiently. Additionally, you might want to consider more advanced data structures for the hash table itself to improve performance.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and plays a crucial role in various algorithms and data structures. In C++, you can implement hash functions and use them for tasks like data retrieval, indexing, and storing key-value pairs efficiently. Here's a brief overview of how hashing works in C++:

#### Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input (or key) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which typically represents a hash code. The hash code is used to index a data structure such as an array or hash table.

In C++, you can define your own hash functions or use built-in ones from libraries like `<functional>`. The standard library provides a `std::hash` template that generates hash codes for various types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::hash<std::string> hash_fn; // Hash function for strings

    std::string key = "example";
    size_t hash_code = hash_fn(key);

    std::cout << "Hash code for '" << key << "': " << hash_code << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Hash Tables

Hash tables are data structures that store key-value pairs based on hash codes. They consist of an array of buckets, where each bucket may store multiple elements (using techniques like chaining or open addressing).

Here's a simple hash table implementation using `std::unordered_map` from the C++ Standard Library:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> hash_table;

    // Inserting key-value pairs
    hash_table["apple"] = 5;
    hash_table["banana"] = 10;
    hash_table["orange"] = 7;

    // Retrieving values
    std::cout << "Value of 'apple': " << hash_table["apple"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Collision Resolution

Collisions occur when two different keys generate the same hash code. Hash tables handle collisions using techniques like chaining (each bucket stores a linked list of elements) or open addressing (search for alternative positions in the table).

#### Custom Hash Functions

For custom types or special requirements, you might need to define your own hash functions. This involves overriding the `std::hash` template or providing a custom hash function object to containers like `std::unordered_map`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

struct MyKey {
    int x;
    std::string y;
};

// Custom hash function for MyKey
struct MyKeyHash {
    size_t operator()(const MyKey& key) const {
        // Define your hash function logic here
        return std::hash<int>()(key.x) ^ (std::hash<std::string>()(key.y) << 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<MyKey, int, MyKeyHash> hash_table;

    // Inserting key-value pairs
    hash_table[{1, "example"}] = 42;

    // Retrieving values
    std::cout << "Value for {1, 'example'}: " << hash_table[{1, "example"}] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Conclusion

Hashing is a powerful technique used in various algorithms and data structures to achieve efficient data retrieval and storage. In C++, you have built-in support for hash functions and hash tables through libraries like `<functional>` and `std::unordered_map`, and you can also define custom hash functions for specific needs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Collisions

Hash collisions occur when two different inputs to a hash function produce the same output, resulting in the same hash value. In the context of algorithms and data structures, this often happens when you're using hash tables or hash maps to store key-value pairs.

Here's how hash collisions are typically handled:

1. **Separate Chaining**: In this approach, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list (or any other suitable data structure) of key-value pairs that have the same hash value. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply appended to the linked list at the corresponding bucket.

2. **Open Addressing**: In this method, when a collision occurs, you probe for an empty slot in the hash table using a different strategy such as linear probing (checking the next slot), quadratic probing (checking slots with quadratic increments), or double hashing (using a secondary hash function to determine the next slot to probe).

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variation of open addressing where you try to move collided elements closer to the start of the probe sequence. This minimizes the average probe length.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: In this technique, you use multiple hash functions and multiple tables. When a collision occurs, the existing element is "kicked out" and placed in its alternative position in the other hash table. This process might recursively trigger further kicks until a stable configuration is reached.

5. **Perfect Hashing**: In cases where the set of keys is known in advance and is static, perfect hashing can be used. It ensures that there are no collisions by carefully designing the hash function.

Each collision resolution strategy has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, separate chaining is simple and efficient when the number of collisions is low, but it requires additional memory overhead for storing linked lists. On the other hand, open addressing methods have better cache locality and can be more memory-efficient but may suffer from clustering and performance degradation under high load factors.

In C++, you can implement hash tables using the `std::unordered_map` or `std::unordered_set` containers, which handle hash collisions internally using techniques like separate chaining. If you need more control over collision resolution, you can implement your own hash table class using one of the collision resolution strategies mentioned above.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Function Ideas

Certainly! Hash functions play a vital role in algorithms and data structures, especially in applications like hash tables, cryptographic functions, and more. Here are some common hash function ideas in C++:

1. **Division Method**:
   - This method involves taking the modulo of the key with a prime number.

   - ```cpp
     size_t hash_function(const std::string& key, size_t table_size) {
         size_t hash = 0;
         for (char c : key) {
             hash = (hash * 31 + c) % table_size;
         }
         return hash;
     }
     ```

2. **Multiplication Method**:
   - This method multiplies the key by a constant, usually a fraction, and extracts the fractional part of the result.

   - ```cpp
     size_t hash_function(const std::string& key, size_t table_size) {
         const double A = 0.6180339887; // Fractional part of the golden ratio
         size_t hash = 0;
         for (char c : key) {
             hash += c;
         }
         return static_cast<size_t>(table_size * (hash * A - std::floor(hash * A)));
     }
     ```

3. **Folding Method**:
   - In this method, the key is divided into equal parts and then added together.

   - ```cpp
     size_t hash_function(const std::string& key, size_t table_size) {
         size_t hash = 0;
         for (size_t i = 0; i < key.size(); i += 4) {
             size_t chunk = 0;
             for (size_t j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
                 if (i + j < key.size()) {
                     chunk += key[i + j];
                 }
             }
             hash += chunk;
         }
         return hash % table_size;
     }
     ```

4. **Polynomial Rolling Hash**:
   - This method treats each character of the key as the coefficient of a polynomial.

   - ```cpp
     size_t hash_function(const std::string& key, size_t table_size) {
         const size_t p = 31; // Prime number
         size_t hash = 0;
         size_t p_pow = 1;
         for (char c : key) {
             hash = (hash + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % table_size;
             p_pow = (p_pow * p) % table_size;
         }
         return hash;
     }
     ```

5. **Custom Hash Functions**:
   - Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to create custom hash functions tailored to your data.
   - For example, for strings, you might consider a combination of character positions, ASCII values, or even a combination of other hash functions.

Remember, the effectiveness of a hash function depends on various factors such as the distribution of keys, collision resolution strategies, and the size of the hash table. It's crucial to analyze these factors and choose or design a hash function accordingly.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Functions

Hash functions are fundamental components of many algorithms and data structures in computer science, used for tasks like indexing data in hash tables, implementing associative arrays, and ensuring data integrity in cryptographic applications. In C++, you can implement hash functions in various ways. Here's a basic overview along with some examples:

#### Hash Functions in C++

##### 1. **Built-in Hash Functions**

   C++ provides built-in hash functions for standard types via the `<functional>` header. You can use `std::hash<T>` to get the hash value of a type `T`.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <functional>

   int main() {
       std::hash<int> intHash;
       std::cout << intHash(42) << std::endl;  // Example hash of integer
       return 0;
   }
   ```

##### 2. **Custom Hash Functions**

   For user-defined types or specific requirements, you might need to implement custom hash functions.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   struct MyKey {
       int x;
       std::string str;
   };

   struct MyKeyHash {
       std::size_t operator()(const MyKey& k) const {
           // Simple hash combining hash values of individual members
           return std::hash<int>()(k.x) ^ (std::hash<std::string>()(k.str) << 1);
       }
   };

   int main() {
       MyKey key = {42, "hello"};
       MyKeyHash hashFunc;
       std::cout << hashFunc(key) << std::endl;  // Custom hash of MyKey
       return 0;
   }
   ```

##### 3. **Choosing a Hash Function**

   When implementing a custom hash function, consider factors like distribution, collision resistance, and efficiency. Ideally, a hash function should evenly distribute keys across the hash table to minimize collisions.

##### 4. **Hash Functions in Standard Containers**

   Standard containers like `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` use hash functions internally for indexing elements. You can provide a custom hash function as a template argument when using these containers with user-defined types.

##### 5. **Hash Collisions**

   Hash collisions occur when different keys produce the same hash value. Handling collisions efficiently is crucial for the performance of hash-based data structures. Techniques like chaining or open addressing are commonly used to resolve collisions.

##### 6. **Performance Considerations**

   A good hash function balances computation time and distribution quality. For performance-critical applications, choose hash functions optimized for speed and minimal collisions.

##### 7. **Cryptographic Hash Functions**

   In addition to standard hash functions, cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 are used for security-sensitive applications such as digital signatures and password hashing. These functions have additional properties like pre-image resistance and collision resistance.

#### Conclusion

Hash functions are versatile tools in C++ programming, enabling efficient data indexing and retrieval in various applications. Whether using built-in functions or implementing custom ones, understanding hash functions is essential for designing efficient algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Table is Full

When a hash table is full, it typically means that there are no more available slots in the underlying array to accommodate additional elements. This situation can occur due to the following reasons:

1. **Load Factor Threshold**: Many hash table implementations define a load factor threshold, which determines when the hash table is considered "full." This threshold is often a ratio of the number of elements in the hash table to the size of the underlying array. When the number of elements exceeds this threshold, the hash table needs to be resized to accommodate more elements efficiently.

2. **Collision Resolution**: If your hash table uses a collision resolution technique such as chaining or open addressing, collisions can occur when multiple elements are mapped to the same slot in the array. In such cases, if all available slots in that chain or probing sequence are filled, the hash table is effectively full.

3. **Static Size**: If the hash table has a fixed size and cannot be resized dynamically, it can become full when the number of elements to be inserted exceeds its capacity.

To handle the situation when a hash table is full, you typically need to implement one or more of the following strategies:

1. **Resize the Hash Table**: When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, you can resize the hash table by creating a new, larger array, and rehashing all elements into the new array. This process can be time-consuming but ensures that the hash table remains efficient.

2. **Rehashing with a Different Hash Function**: Sometimes, changing the hash function can distribute the elements more evenly across the hash table, reducing the likelihood of collisions and preventing the table from becoming full prematurely.

3. **Dynamic Resizing**: Implement a hash table that dynamically resizes itself as needed, ensuring that the load factor remains within an acceptable range. This approach minimizes the risk of the hash table becoming full.

4. **Alternative Data Structures**: If resizing the hash table is not feasible, consider using alternative data structures that provide similar functionality, such as balanced binary search trees.

Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and implementation complexity, so the choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Table: Finding Pairs with Same Number Sums

To find pairs with the same number sums using a hash table in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a hash table where the key is the sum of pairs and the value is a list of pairs that have that sum.
2. Iterate through the input array and for each pair, calculate the sum.
3. Check if the sum already exists in the hash table.
   - If it does, add the current pair to the list of pairs with that sum.
   - If it doesn't, create a new list with the current pair and add it to the hash table with the sum as the key.
4. After iterating through all pairs, iterate through the hash table and for each key, if the list associated with that key has more than one pair, output those pairs.

Here's a sample implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

void findPairsWithSameSum(const vector<pair<int, int>>& pairs) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> hashTable;

    // Step 1: Populate the hash table
    for (const auto& p : pairs) {
        int sum = p.first + p.second;
        hashTable[sum].push_back(p);
    }

    // Step 2: Output pairs with the same sum
    for (const auto& entry : hashTable) {
        if (entry.second.size() > 1) {
            cout << "Pairs with sum " << entry.first << ":" << endl;
            for (const auto& pair : entry.second) {
                cout << "(" << pair.first << ", " << pair.second << ")" << endl;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<pair<int, int>> pairs = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 2}, {8, 0}, {3, 6}, {9, 1}};

    findPairsWithSameSum(pairs);

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output pairs that have the same sum. You can modify it according to your specific requirements and input format.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables

Hash tables are fundamental data structures in computer science used for efficient data storage and retrieval. In C++, you can implement hash tables using the standard template library's `unordered_map` or `unordered_set`. Here's a brief overview of how to use hash tables in C++:

#### `unordered_map`

`unordered_map` is used to store key-value pairs. It provides average constant-time complexity O(1) for insertion, deletion, and retrieval, making it ideal for storing large amounts of data where quick lookups are required.

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Insert key-value pairs
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 2;
    myMap["orange"] = 8;

    // Retrieve value by key
    std::cout << "Value of apple: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Check if key exists
    if (myMap.find("banana") != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Banana exists!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterate through all key-value pairs
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### `unordered_set`

`unordered_set` is used to store unique elements. It provides average constant-time complexity O(1) for insertion, deletion, and searching for an element.

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_set<int> mySet;

    // Insert elements
    mySet.insert(10);
    mySet.insert(20);
    mySet.insert(30);

    // Check if an element exists
    if (mySet.find(20) != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << "Element 20 exists!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterate through elements
    for (const auto& elem : mySet) {
        std::cout << elem << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Custom Hash Function

You can also define custom hash functions for user-defined types. This is useful when you want to use custom objects as keys in your hash table.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

struct MyKey {
    std::string name;
    int id;
    // Implementing custom hash function
    size_t operator()(const MyKey& key) const {
        return std::hash<std::string>()(key.name) ^ (std::hash<int>()(key.id) << 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<MyKey, int, MyKey> myMap;

    MyKey key1{"John", 1};
    MyKey key2{"Alice", 2};

    myMap[key1] = 100;
    myMap[key2] = 200;

    std::cout << myMap[key1] << std::endl;
    std::cout << myMap[key2] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

These are just basic examples to get you started with hash tables in C++. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to delve deeper into hash table implementations and optimizations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables / Dictionaries question: 4sum 2

The "4Sum II" problem is a classic algorithmic problem that can be solved efficiently using hash tables (also known as dictionaries). Here's the problem statement:

Given four lists A, B, C, and D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.

To solve this problem using hash tables, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a hash table (dictionary) to store the sums of pairs from the arrays A and B. The keys of the dictionary will be the sums, and the values will be the count of occurrences of that sum.
2. Iterate through arrays C and D and for each pair of elements, calculate their sum. Check if the negative of this sum exists in the hash table. If it does, increment a counter by the value corresponding to the negative sum in the hash table.
3. Return the counter, which represents the total number of tuples.

Here's a C++ implementation of this approach:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int fourSumCount(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B, vector<int>& C, vector<int>& D) {
    unordered_map<int, int> AB_sum_count;

    // Count the sums of pairs from A and B
    for (int a : A) {
        for (int b : B) {
            AB_sum_count[a + b]++;
        }
    }

    int count = 0;

    // Check sums of pairs from C and D
    for (int c : C) {
        for (int d : D) {
            int target = -(c + d); // Find the negative of the sum
            if (AB_sum_count.find(target) != AB_sum_count.end()) {
                count += AB_sum_count[target]; // Increment counter by the count of the negative sum
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> A = {1, 2};
    vector<int> B = {-2, -1};
    vector<int> C = {-1, 2};
    vector<int> D = {0, 2};

    int result = fourSumCount(A, B, C, D);
    cout << "Number of tuples: " << result << endl; // Output: Number of tuples: 2

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input arrays, as it involves two nested loops over the arrays. The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the hash table storing the sums of pairs from A and B.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables Hash Function

In C++, the hash function for hash tables plays a crucial role in distributing the keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions. Here's a basic example of how you might implement a hash function for strings:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Define the size of the hash table
const int TABLE_SIZE = 100;

class HashTable {
private:
    // Define a struct for key-value pairs
    struct Node {
        std::string key;
        int value;
        Node* next;
        Node(const std::string& k, int v) : key(k), value(v), next(nullptr) {}
    };

    // Array of pointers to Nodes
    Node* table[TABLE_SIZE];

    // Hash function to convert a string key into an index
    int hash(const std::string& key) {
        int hashValue = 0;
        for (char c : key) {
            hashValue += c;
        }
        return hashValue % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    HashTable() {
        // Initialize all elements of the array to nullptr
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; ++i) {
            table[i] = nullptr;
        }
    }

    // Insert a key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(const std::string& key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        Node* newNode = new Node(key, value);
        if (table[index] == nullptr) {
            // No collision, directly insert
            table[index] = newNode;
        } else {
            // Collision handling: prepend to the linked list
            newNode->next = table[index];
            table[index] = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Retrieve the value associated with a key
    int get(const std::string& key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        Node* current = table[index];
        while (current != nullptr) {
            if (current->key == key) {
                return current->value;
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
        // Key not found
        return -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert("John", 25);
    ht.insert("Emily", 30);
    ht.insert("Michael", 35);

    std::cout << "John's age: " << ht.get("John") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Emily's age: " << ht.get("Emily") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Michael's age: " << ht.get("Michael") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of a hash table using separate chaining to handle collisions. The `hash` function converts a string key into an index within the range `[0, TABLE_SIZE - 1]`. The `insert` function inserts a key-value pair into the hash table, handling collisions by chaining nodes. The `get` function retrieves the value associated with a given key.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables VS Arrays

Hash tables and arrays are both fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Let's compare them in the context of C++:

1. **Hash Tables**:
   - **Purpose**: Hash tables are used to implement associative arrays or mappings of key-value pairs. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
   - **Implementation**: In C++, hash tables are typically implemented using the `std::unordered_map` from the Standard Template Library (STL). This implementation uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, providing fast access to values.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Fast lookup: Average case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations is O(1).
     - Flexible key types: Hash tables can use a wide range of data types as keys.
     - Dynamic resizing: Hash tables can dynamically resize themselves to maintain efficiency as the number of elements changes.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Hash collisions: If two keys hash to the same index, additional handling is required to resolve collisions, which can degrade performance.
     - Space overhead: Hash tables may consume more memory than arrays due to internal structures such as hash buckets.
   - **Use Cases**: Hash tables are suitable for scenarios where fast lookup by key is required, such as symbol tables, caches, and database indexing.

2. **Arrays**:
   - **Purpose**: Arrays are collections of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. They offer direct access to individual elements using integer indices.
   - **Implementation**: In C++, arrays can be implemented using built-in arrays (`int arr[10]`) or the `std::array` container from the STL.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Direct access: Arrays provide constant-time access to elements using integer indices.
     - Compact memory representation: Arrays have minimal memory overhead compared to other data structures.
     - Cache locality: Elements in an array are stored contiguously, which can lead to better cache performance.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Fixed size: In C++, built-in arrays have a fixed size, meaning their size cannot be changed after declaration. `std::array` offers some flexibility but still has a fixed size.
     - Inefficient insertion and deletion: Insertion and deletion operations may require shifting elements, resulting in O(n) time complexity in the worst case.
   - **Use Cases**: Arrays are suitable for scenarios where direct access to elements and efficient iteration are important, such as implementing lists, stacks, queues, and matrices.

In summary, hash tables are preferred when fast lookup by key is essential, and the key set is dynamic. Arrays are suitable for scenarios where direct access to elements and efficient memory usage are prioritized, especially when the size of the collection is fixed or known in advance.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Big O

Hash tables are widely used data structures in computer science for efficient data storage and retrieval. In terms of time complexity (Big O notation), hash tables offer excellent performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations under certain conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the typical time complexities for hash table operations:

1. **Insertion (Average Case):** O(1)
   - In the average case, inserting an element into a hash table takes constant time. This assumes that the hash function distributes elements evenly across the hash table's buckets, resulting in constant-time insertion.

2. **Deletion (Average Case):** O(1)
   - Similar to insertion, deleting an element from a hash table in the average case also takes constant time, assuming a well-distributed hash function.

3. **Lookup (Average Case):** O(1)
   - Searching for an element in a hash table typically takes constant time on average. This assumes that the hash function distributes elements uniformly across the table, leading to constant-time lookup.

However, it's important to note that these time complexities are based on the average case performance. In the worst-case scenario, the time complexity for these operations can degrade:

1. **Insertion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - In the worst case, when all elements hash to the same bucket (resulting in a long linked list or similar structure), insertion can take linear time as it may require traversing the entire list to find the correct position.

2. **Deletion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - Similarly, if all elements hash to the same bucket, deleting an element may also take linear time in the worst case.

3. **Lookup (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - If all elements hash to the same bucket, searching for an element may require traversing a long list within that bucket, resulting in linear time complexity.

To mitigate the risk of worst-case performance, good hash functions and techniques such as resizing the hash table and using techniques like chaining or open addressing with probing are employed.

Overall, hash tables provide efficient average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, making them a popular choice for implementing associative arrays, sets, and other data structures in various programming languages, including C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): hash tables: Collision handling

In hash tables, collision handling is the process of dealing with situations where two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. There are several common methods for handling collisions in hash tables, including:

1. **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket in the hash table is a linked list of key-value pairs. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply added to the linked list at the corresponding bucket. Chaining is easy to implement and works well when the number of collisions is low.

2. **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for an empty slot in the hash table by probing or rehashing. There are different strategies for probing, such as linear probing (checking the next slot), quadratic probing (checking slots with quadratic increments), or double hashing (using a second hash function to determine the next slot). Open addressing is more memory-efficient than chaining because it doesn't require additional data structures for each bucket, but it can suffer from clustering and performance degradation when the hash table becomes densely populated.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variation of open addressing that tries to minimize the variance in probe sequence lengths. When a new element is inserted and a collision occurs, it's placed in the bucket and then swaps with elements that have probed less distance than it. This helps in flattening the distribution of elements in the hash table.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: In cuckoo hashing, each key is assigned to one of the multiple hash tables. When a collision occurs in one table, the key is moved to another table based on a different hash function. This process continues until no collisions occur. If a cycle is detected during this process, the hash tables are resized and rehashed.

5. **Coalesced Hashing**: This is a variation of chaining where instead of using linked lists, all elements are stored in one large array. Each element in the array contains a pointer to the next element in the chain. This reduces memory overhead compared to traditional chaining, but it requires careful management of the array to avoid fragmentation.

Each collision handling method has its own trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and ease of implementation. The choice of method depends on factors such as the expected load factor of the hash table, the distribution of keys, and the desired performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): hash tables: Collision handling techniques comparison

In C++, hash tables are commonly used to implement associative arrays or mappings of key-value pairs. Hash tables rely on hash functions to map keys to indices in an array, but collisions can occur when different keys map to the same index. There are several collision handling techniques to address this issue. Let's compare a few of them:

1. **Separate Chaining**:
    - In separate chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the collided elements are simply appended to the linked list in that bucket.
    - This technique is relatively simple to implement and works well when collisions are infrequent.
    - However, it can result in increased memory usage due to the overhead of maintaining linked lists, and performance can degrade if the linked lists become too long.

2. **Open Addressing**:
    - Open addressing avoids linked lists by storing all elements directly within the hash table array itself. When a collision occurs, the algorithm probes for an empty slot by applying a secondary hash function or using a predefined sequence of offsets.
    - Common open addressing methods include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.
    - Open addressing can have better cache performance compared to separate chaining since it keeps elements contiguous in memory.
    - However, it may suffer from clustering, where consecutive collisions cause further collisions and degrade performance. Additionally, it's more complex to implement and manage than separate chaining.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**:
    - Robin Hood hashing is a variation of open addressing where elements are inserted by "robbing" space from elements that are further from their ideal positions.
    - When a collision occurs, the algorithm compares the distance from the ideal position of the new element to the distance of the existing element in the slot. If the new element's distance is shorter, it swaps places with the existing element and continues probing.
    - This technique aims to reduce the variance in probe lengths, leading to better average-case performance compared to traditional open addressing methods.
    - However, it requires additional bookkeeping to track distances and may still suffer from clustering.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**:
    - Cuckoo hashing involves using multiple hash functions and multiple hash tables. Each key is hashed by multiple hash functions, and if a collision occurs in one table, the key is "kicked out" to another table using a different hash function.
    - This technique can provide constant lookup time in theory and can have good cache performance.
    - However, it requires careful choice of hash functions and resizing mechanisms to maintain efficiency. Additionally, in worst-case scenarios, it may require rehashing the entire table, which can be costly.

Choosing the right collision handling technique depends on factors such as the expected distribution of keys, memory constraints, and performance requirements. Each technique has its advantages and trade-offs, and the choice often involves balancing these factors based on the specific use case.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Collisions

Hash tables are a fundamental data structure for storing and retrieving key-value pairs efficiently. They are designed to provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. However, collisions can occur in hash tables, which can affect their performance if not handled properly.

Here's how collisions work in hash tables and how they are typically managed:

1. **Collision Definition**:
   - A collision happens when two different keys map to the same index in the hash table's internal array, i.e., they have the same hash value.
   - Since hash functions can't guarantee unique indexes for all possible inputs due to the pigeonhole principle, collisions are inevitable.

2. **Collision Resolution Techniques**:
   - **Chaining**: In chaining, each slot of the hash table's array contains a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is added to the linked list at that index.
   - **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for another empty slot in the hash table by applying a probing sequence (like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing). This continues until an empty slot is found, and then the key-value pair is inserted there.

3. **Chaining**:
   - Chaining is one of the most common collision resolution techniques.
   - Each element of the hash table is a linked list of elements.
   - Collisions are resolved by appending the colliding elements to the linked list at the corresponding index.
   - Retrieval involves computing the hash, traversing the linked list, and finding the element with the matching key.

4. **Load Factor**:
   - The load factor of a hash table is the ratio of the number of elements stored in the hash table to the size of the table.
   - Load factor = Number of elements / Size of table.
   - A higher load factor means more collisions and potentially slower performance.
   - Typically, hash tables are resized or rehashed when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold to maintain efficiency.

5. **Performance**:
   - The performance of a hash table depends on the efficiency of the hash function, the collision resolution strategy, and the load factor.
   - Ideally, the hash function should distribute keys uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions.
   - Collision resolution strategies should aim to minimize clustering and the length of linked lists (for chaining) or the number of probes (for open addressing).
   - Keeping the load factor low helps in reducing collisions and maintaining performance.

In C++, you can implement hash tables using the `std::unordered_map` for chaining-based hash tables and `std::unordered_set` for sets. For custom implementations, you would typically need to define your own hash function and handle collisions using either chaining or open addressing techniques.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Constructor

In C++, a hash table is typically implemented using the `unordered_map` container from the Standard Template Library (STL). The `unordered_map` is a hash table that maps keys to values, and it provides constant-time average complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

Here's how you can create a hash table (unordered_map) and initialize it with some initial values using its constructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Create a hash table mapping strings to integers
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> hashTable = {
        {"apple", 5},
        {"banana", 7},
        {"orange", 3}
    };

    // Iterate over the hash table and print each key-value pair
    for (const auto& pair : hashTable) {
        std::cout << "Key: " << pair.first << ", Value: " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We include necessary headers for `unordered_map`, `string`, and `iostream`.
- We create an `unordered_map` named `hashTable` that maps strings to integers.
- We initialize the `hashTable` with some initial values using the constructor's initializer list syntax.
- We then iterate over the hash table using a range-based for loop and print each key-value pair.

This creates a hash table with the specified initial key-value pairs. You can further manipulate the hash table by inserting, deleting, or modifying elements as needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Find Duplicates

Certainly! Below is a C++ implementation of finding duplicates using hash tables:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

void findDuplicates(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequency;

    // Count frequency of each element
    for (int num : nums) {
        frequency[num]++;
    }

    // Print duplicates
    bool foundDuplicates = false;
    for (const auto& pair : frequency) {
        if (pair.second > 1) {
            std::cout << "Duplicate element: " << pair.first << ", Frequency: " << pair.second << std::endl;
            foundDuplicates = true;
        }
    }

    if (!foundDuplicates) {
        std::cout << "No duplicates found." << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9};
    findDuplicates(nums);
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a function `findDuplicates` that takes a vector of integers `nums` as input. It uses an `unordered_map` to store the frequency of each element in the vector. Then, it iterates over the map and prints the elements that have a frequency greater than 1, indicating duplicates.

In the `main` function, a sample vector `nums` is created and passed to `findDuplicates` to demonstrate the functionality. You can replace `nums` with any vector of integers to find duplicates within it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: First Non-Repeating Character

To find the first non-repeating character in a string using a hash table in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a hash table to store the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Iterate through the string to populate the hash table.
3. Iterate through the string again and check the frequency of each character in the hash table. The first character with a frequency of 1 is the first non-repeating character.
4. Return the index of the first non-repeating character.

Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int firstNonRepeatingCharacter(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> frequency;
    
    // Populate the frequency map
    for (char c : s) {
        frequency[c]++;
    }
    
    // Iterate through the string to find the first non-repeating character
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (frequency[s[i]] == 1) {
            return i; // Found the first non-repeating character
        }
    }
    
    // If no non-repeating character found, return -1
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    string s = "leetcode";
    int index = firstNonRepeatingCharacter(s);
    if (index != -1) {
        cout << "First non-repeating character: " << s[index] << ", Index: " << index << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No non-repeating character found." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string since we iterate through the string twice, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the hash table storing character frequencies.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Get

In C++, hash tables are typically implemented using the `std::unordered_map` container from the Standard Template Library (STL). The `std::unordered_map` provides a hash table-based associative container where data is stored as key-value pairs.

Here's how you can use `std::unordered_map` to implement a hash table and retrieve values:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Create an unordered_map with string keys and int values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Insert some key-value pairs
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 8;
    myMap["orange"] = 10;

    // Retrieve values using keys
    std::string key = "banana";
    if (myMap.find(key) != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "The value associated with key '" << key << "' is: " << myMap[key] << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Key '" << key << "' not found!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

1. We include necessary header files: `<iostream>` for input/output, `<unordered_map>` for unordered_map, and `<string>` for string manipulation.
2. We declare an `std::unordered_map` named `myMap` with `std::string` as keys and `int` as values.
3. We insert some key-value pairs into the map using the subscript operator `[]`.
4. We retrieve the value associated with a key ("banana") using the `[]` operator. Before doing this, we check if the key exists in the map using the `find()` function, which returns an iterator pointing to the element if found, or `myMap.end()` if not found.
5. If the key exists, we print the associated value. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that the key was not found.

This is a basic demonstration of how to use a hash table (implemented as `std::unordered_map`) to store and retrieve data in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Group Anagrams

Grouping anagrams involves categorizing words that are anagrams of each other into separate groups. Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order (e.g., "listen" and "silent"). We can use a hash table to efficiently group anagrams.

Here's how you can implement it in C++ using a hash table:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> anagramGroups;

    // Iterate through each word in the input vector
    for (const string& word : strs) {
        // Sort the characters of the word to get its canonical form
        string sortedWord = word;
        sort(sortedWord.begin(), sortedWord.end());

        // Add the word to the corresponding group based on its sorted form
        anagramGroups[sortedWord].push_back(word);
    }

    // Convert the map of anagram groups to a vector of vectors
    vector<vector<string>> result;
    for (auto& group : anagramGroups) {
        result.push_back(group.second);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"};

    vector<vector<string>> anagramGroups = groupAnagrams(words);

    // Output the grouped anagrams
    for (const auto& group : anagramGroups) {
        for (const string& word : group) {
            cout << word << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We iterate through each word in the input vector `strs`.
2. For each word, we sort its characters to obtain a canonical form.
3. We use this canonical form as a key in the hash table. Words with the same canonical form (i.e., anagrams) will be grouped together under the same key.
4. Finally, we convert the hash table into a vector of vectors, where each inner vector contains the words that are anagrams of each other.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n *k* log(k)), where n is the number of words and k is the average length of each word. The dominant factor is the sorting of characters within each word.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Hash Function

In C++, when implementing hash tables, designing an efficient hash function is crucial. A hash function maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes). The quality of the hash function directly impacts the performance of hash tables, affecting their collision resolution and overall efficiency.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement a hash function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Example hash function for strings
size_t customHash(const std::string& key, size_t tableSize) {
    size_t hash = 0;
    for (char ch : key) {
        hash = hash * 31 + ch;  // Using a prime multiplier for better distribution
    }
    return hash % tableSize;   // Ensure the result is within the table size
}

int main() {
    std::string key = "example";
    size_t tableSize = 100; // Size of the hash table

    size_t hashValue = customHash(key, tableSize);
    std::cout << "Hash value for '" << key << "': " << hashValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `customHash` is a simple hash function that takes a string `key` and the size of the hash table `tableSize` as input parameters.
- It iterates through each character of the input string and accumulates a hash value using a prime multiplier (31 is commonly used).
- Finally, it takes the modulus of the accumulated hash value with the table size to ensure that the resulting hash code fits within the range of indices in the hash table.

Remember, the choice of hash function can vary based on the nature of the data being hashed and the requirements of the application. In real-world scenarios, you may need to consider more sophisticated hash functions, especially if you're dealing with complex data types or require specific performance characteristics. Additionally, hash functions should aim for a uniform distribution of hash codes to minimize collisions and maximize the efficiency of the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: How do you convert a hash into its index?

In hash tables, the process of converting a hash into its index involves mapping the hash value to a valid index within the table's array. This mapping is typically done using a technique called "hash function." Here's how it generally works:

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes the input (e.g., a key or some data) and computes a hash value. This hash value is usually an integer.

2. **Modulus Operation**: Once you have the hash value, you need to map it to an index within the array of the hash table. A common approach is to use the modulus (%) operator. This operation gives the remainder when the hash value is divided by the size of the array (the number of slots in the hash table).

    ```cpp
    int hashValue = computeHash(key); // Compute hash value for the given key
    int index = hashValue % arraySize; // Map hash value to an index within the array
    ```

3. **Handling Collisions**: Since different keys may hash to the same index (a situation known as a collision), you need to handle collisions. Common techniques include using separate chaining (each index in the array is a linked list of elements that hash to that index) or open addressing (search for the next available slot in the array).

4. **Uniform Distribution**: A good hash function aims to produce hash values that are uniformly distributed across the indices of the hash table. This helps minimize collisions and ensures efficient performance of the hash table.

Here's a simple example using a basic hash function and the modulus operation:

```cpp
int hashFunction(int key, int arraySize) {
    // A simple hash function: just return the key modulo arraySize
    return key % arraySize;
}

// Example usage:
int arraySize = 10; // Size of the hash table array
int key = 42;       // Key to be hashed
int index = hashFunction(key, arraySize); // Compute the index for the key
```

Keep in mind that the choice of hash function and collision resolution strategy can significantly impact the performance of the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: How does hashing work?

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly when dealing with data structures like hash tables. At its core, hashing is a process of mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes or hashes) through a function called a hash function. This hash function takes an input (often referred to as the "key") and produces a numerical value, typically within a specific range.

Here's a step-by-step overview of how hashing works:

1. **Input Data**: You start with your input data, which could be anything from strings, numbers, objects, etc. In the context of hash tables, this input data is usually the key that you want to store or retrieve.

2. **Hash Function**: This is the heart of hashing. The hash function takes the input data and produces a fixed-size hash code. The goal of a good hash function is to evenly distribute the hash codes across the available range of values to minimize collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash code).

3. **Hash Code**: The output of the hash function is the hash code, which is typically a numerical value. This hash code is then used as an index to store or retrieve data in the hash table.

4. **Storage**: In a hash table, the hash code is used as an index to store the data in an array-like structure called a hash table. The data is typically stored in a data structure like an array, linked list, or tree.

5. **Collision Handling**: Collisions can occur when two different inputs produce the same hash code. There are various strategies for handling collisions, such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store multiple items at the same index), open addressing (finding an alternative location in the hash table), or using techniques like Robin Hood hashing or cuckoo hashing.

6. **Retrieval**: When you want to retrieve data from the hash table using a key, you pass the key through the hash function to get its hash code. Then, you use this hash code to look up the corresponding data in the hash table.

Overall, hashing is a powerful technique for organizing and accessing data quickly, especially in scenarios where you need fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs, as in the case of hash tables. The efficiency and effectiveness of hashing often depend on the quality of the hash function and the collision resolution strategy used.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: How to deal with collisions

In hash tables, collisions occur when two different keys hash to the same index in the table. There are several techniques to handle collisions:

1. **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list of elements that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new element is simply appended to the linked list. This way, multiple elements can coexist at the same index without issue.

2. **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, an alternative location is sought within the hash table itself. This can be achieved through various techniques such as linear probing (moving to the next available slot), quadratic probing (using a quadratic function to find the next slot), or double hashing (using a second hash function to calculate an offset). The idea is to find an empty slot within the table to place the collided element.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variation of open addressing where when a collision occurs, the newly inserted element is placed in the next available slot if its displacement (distance from its ideal position) is less than that of the element already in that slot. This helps in maintaining a more balanced distribution of elements and can improve performance.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: In cuckoo hashing, each key can be placed in one of two possible locations, determined by two different hash functions. When a collision occurs, the existing element is "kicked out" and moved to its alternative location, making room for the new element. This process may recursively continue until all elements find their correct places or a predefined threshold is exceeded.

Each of these collision resolution strategies has its advantages and drawbacks, and the choice depends on factors such as expected load factor, memory constraints, and performance requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Interview Question

Sure, here's a classic interview question related to hash tables in C++:

**Question**: Implement a hash table (also known as a hash map) in C++. Your implementation should support the following operations:

1. `insert(key, value)`: Insert a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, update the corresponding value.
2. `get(key)`: Get the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn't exist, return a specified default value.
3. `remove(key)`: Remove a key-value pair from the hash table.

You may assume that the keys are unique.

**Solution**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
using namespace std;

class HashMap {
private:
    // Structure for key-value pairs
    struct KeyValuePair {
        int key;
        int value;
        KeyValuePair(int k, int v) : key(k), value(v) {}
    };
    
    // Hash table implemented using a vector of linked lists
    vector



```cpp




```cpp
        <list<KeyValuePair>> table;
    int size; // Number of elements in the hash table

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % table.size();
    }

public:
    HashMap(int initialSize = 100) : size(0) {
        // Initialize hash table with empty linked lists
        table.resize(initialSize);
    }

    // Insert/update key-value pair
    void insert(int key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        // Search for existing key
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.key == key) {
                pair.value = value; // Update value if key exists
                return;
            }
        }
        // If key doesn't exist, add a new key-value pair
        table[index].emplace_back(key, value);
        size++;
    }

    // Get value associated with key
    int get(int key, int defaultValue = -1) {
        int index = hash(key);
        // Search for key in the linked list at the corresponding index
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.key == key) {
                return pair.value; // Return value if key is found
            }
        }
        return defaultValue; // Return default value if key is not found
    }

    // Remove key-value pair
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        // Search for key in the linked list at the corresponding index
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (it->key == key) {
                table[index].erase(it); // Remove key-value pair
                size--;
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

This implementation uses separate chaining to handle collisions, where each element of the hash table is a linked list of key-value pairs. The `hash` function calculates the index of the key in the hash table, and the `insert`, `get`, and `remove` methods operate accordingly on this index.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Item In Common

Certainly! If you're looking to implement a hash table in C++ to find common items between two arrays, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Hash Table**: Implement a hash table data structure. You can use `std::unordered_map` from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

2. **Insert Items**: Iterate through the first array and insert each item into the hash table.

3. **Check Common Items**: Iterate through the second array. For each item, check if it exists in the hash table. If it does, then it's a common item.

Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

// Function to find common items between two arrays using hash tables
std::vector<int> findCommonItems(const std::vector<int>& arr1, const std::vector<int>& arr2) {
    std::unordered_map<int, bool> hashTable;
    std::vector<int> commonItems;

    // Insert items from the first array into the hash table
    for (int item : arr1) {
        hashTable[item] = true;
    }

    // Check items from the second array against the hash table
    for (int item : arr2) {
        if (hashTable.find(item) != hashTable.end()) {
            commonItems.push_back(item);
        }
    }

    return commonItems;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> arr2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

    std::vector<int> commonItems = findCommonItems(arr1, arr2);

    std::cout << "Common items: ";
    for (int item : commonItems) {
        std::cout << item << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `findCommonItems` function takes two vectors representing the arrays and returns a vector containing the common items between them. It uses `std::unordered_map` as the hash table implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Keys

In C++, when working with hash tables, the keys are the unique identifiers associated with each value stored in the hash table. These keys are used to compute a hash value, which determines the index or bucket where the corresponding value will be stored in the hash table.

Here's a brief overview of how keys are typically handled in hash tables:

1. **Key Type**: Keys can be of any data type that supports hashing. In C++, this includes built-in types like integers, strings, and user-defined types for which you've implemented a custom hash function.

2. **Hash Function**: A hash function is applied to each key to compute its hash value. The hash function should distribute keys evenly across the available buckets in the hash table to minimize collisions (where multiple keys hash to the same index).

3. **Hash Collisions**: Since hash functions may produce the same hash value for different keys (collision), hash tables typically handle collisions using techniques like chaining (keeping a list of values for each bucket) or open addressing (finding alternative locations for keys).

4. **Equality Comparison**: When searching for a key in the hash table, the same hash function is applied to the search key to find its corresponding bucket. Then, an equality comparison is performed between the search key and the keys stored in that bucket to determine if a match is found.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of keys in a hash table in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Define a hash table mapping strings (keys) to integers (values)
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> hashTable;

    // Inserting key-value pairs into the hash table
    hashTable["apple"] = 10;
    hashTable["banana"] = 20;
    hashTable["orange"] = 15;

    // Accessing values using keys
    std::cout << "The value associated with 'banana' is: " << hashTable["banana"] << std::endl;

    // Checking if a key exists in the hash table
    if (hashTable.find("apple") != hashTable.end()) {
        std::cout << "'apple' is found in the hash table." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "'apple' is not found in the hash table." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `"apple"`, `"banana"`, and `"orange"` are keys, and `10`, `20`, and `15` are their corresponding values. We use the keys to access and manipulate the values stored in the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Set

A hash set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements, much like a mathematical set. It is implemented using a hash table under the hood, where elements are stored in such a way that it's easy to determine if a given element is present in the set or not.

In C++, you can implement a hash set using the `std::unordered_set` from the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's a basic example of how to use `std::unordered_set`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    // Create an unordered_set of integers
    std::unordered_set<int> mySet;

    // Insert elements into the set
    mySet.insert(10);
    mySet.insert(20);
    mySet.insert(30);

    // Check if an element is present in the set
    if (mySet.find(20) != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << "Element 20 is present in the set\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element 20 is not present in the set\n";
    }

    // Iterate over the elements of the set
    std::cout << "Set elements: ";
    for (int x : mySet) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    // Erase an element from the set
    mySet.erase(20);

    // Check the size of the set
    std::cout << "Size of set after erasing: " << mySet.size() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the basic operations of a hash set: insertion, searching, deletion, and iteration. Note that elements in a hash set are not stored in any particular order, and duplicates are not allowed. The `std::unordered_set` uses a hash function to map each element to a unique bucket, allowing for constant-time average complexity for insertion, deletion, and searching operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Subarray Sum

Sure, let's dive into the problem of finding if there exists a subarray with a given sum in an array. This problem can be efficiently solved using hash tables. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> sumCount; // Stores the count of prefix sums
    
    int sum = 0;
    sumCount[0] = 1; // Initialize with 0 sum having count 1
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
        // If a subarray with sum (sum - k) exists, then a subarray with sum k exists
        if (sumCount.find(sum - k) != sumCount.end())
            return true;
        // Increment the count of current sum
        sumCount[sum]++;
    }
    
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 9;
    if (subarraySum(nums, k))
        cout << "Subarray with sum " << k << " exists." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Subarray with sum " << k << " does not exist." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code will output "Subarray with sum 9 exists." since there is a subarray [2, 3, 4] whose sum is 9.

Explanation:

- We maintain a running sum (`sum`) as we traverse the array.
- At each step, we check if `sum - k` exists in the `sumCount` hash table. If it does, that means a subarray with sum `k` exists between the previous occurrence of `sum - k` and the current index.
- If not, we add the current sum to the `sumCount` hash table.
- We initialize the `sumCount` hash table with `0` having a count of `1`, which denotes that an empty subarray has a sum of `0`.
- Finally, if we don't find any subarray with sum `k`, we return false.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash Tables: Two Sum

The "Two Sum" problem is a classic algorithmic problem where you're given an array of integers and a target sum. You need to find two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum and return their indices.

Here's how you can solve it using a hash table in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

std::vector<int> twoSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> numMap;
    std::vector<int> result;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (numMap.find(complement) != numMap.end()) {
            result.push_back(numMap[complement]);
            result.push_back(i);
            return result;
        }
        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    // If no solution found
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 7, 11, 15};
    int target = 9;

    std::vector<int> indices = twoSum(nums, target);
    if (indices.size() == 2) {
        std::cout << "Indices: " << indices[0] << ", " << indices[1] << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No two sum solution." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through the array once. For each element, we calculate its complement (the number needed to reach the target sum). Then, we check if the complement exists in the hash table. If it does, we've found the solution and return the indices of the two numbers. If not, we add the current number and its index to the hash table. This way, we can look up whether the complement of a number we've previously encountered exists in constant time.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash: Count

In C++, hash counting typically involves using a hash table or a hash map to efficiently store and retrieve the counts of elements. Here's a basic example of how you can implement hash counting using `std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

// Function to count the occurrences of elements in an array using hash map
std::unordered_map<int, int> countElements(const int arr[], int size) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> counts;

    // Iterate through the array and update the counts in the map
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        counts[arr[i]]++;
    }

    return counts;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    // Count the occurrences of elements
    std::unordered_map<int, int> counts = countElements(arr, size);

    // Print the counts
    for (const auto& pair : counts) {
        std::cout << pair.first << " occurs " << pair.second << " times" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::unordered_map` is used to store the counts of elements. The `countElements` function takes an array and its size as input and returns an `unordered_map<int, int>` where the keys are the elements of the array, and the values are their corresponding counts.

This approach provides efficient insertion and lookup time complexity, typically O(1) on average, making it suitable for counting occurrences of elements in large datasets.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash: Counting the Text String that Appears the Most Number of Times

To count the text string that appears the most number of times using hashing in C++, you can use a hash map (unordered_map in C++ STL) to store the count of each text string. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

string findMostFrequent(const string& text, int k) {
    unordered_map<string, int> freqMap;

    // Split the text into words
    istringstream iss(text);
    string word;
    while (iss >> word) {
        // Convert to lowercase (if needed)
        // For case-insensitive comparison
        // transform(word.begin(), word.end(), word.begin(), ::tolower);

        // Increment the count of the word in the map
        freqMap[word]++;
    }

    // Find the most frequent word
    string mostFrequentWord;
    int maxFreq = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : freqMap) {
        if (entry.second > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = entry.second;
            mostFrequentWord = entry.first;
        }
    }

    return mostFrequentWord;
}

int main() {
    string text = "This is a sample text with some repeated words like sample and text";
    int k = 1; // Change k to count the k most frequent strings

    string mostFrequent = findMostFrequent(text, k);
    cout << "Most frequent string: " << mostFrequent << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will find the most frequently occurring string in the given text. You can modify it to find the k most frequent strings by maintaining a priority queue or sorting the entries based on frequency.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hash: Finding Symmetric Pairs

Finding symmetric pairs in a hash table involves identifying pairs of elements such that (a, b) and (b, a) exist in the given set of elements. Here's how you can implement this in C++ using a hash table:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to find symmetric pairs
void findSymmetricPairs(const vector<pair<int, int>>& pairs) {
    unordered_map<int, int> hash;

    for (const auto& pair : pairs) {
        int first = pair.first;
        int second = pair.second;

        // Check if the symmetric pair exists
        if (hash.find(second) != hash.end() && hash[second] == first) {
            cout << "(" << first << ", " << second << ") and (" << second << ", " << first << ")" << endl;
        } else {
            // Insert the pair in the hash table
            hash[first] = second;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<pair<int, int>> pairs = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}, {8, 9}, {9, 8}};

    cout << "Symmetric pairs are:" << endl;
    findSymmetricPairs(pairs);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We use an unordered map (`hash`) to store key-value pairs where the key is the first element of the pair and the value is the second element of the pair.
- We iterate through each pair in the input vector.
- For each pair, we check if its symmetric pair exists in the hash table. If it does, we print both pairs.
- If the symmetric pair doesn't exist, we insert the current pair into the hash table.
- Finally, we call the `findSymmetricPairs` function with the input vector of pairs and print the symmetric pairs found.

This code will output all the symmetric pairs present in the input vector.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications, including data storage, retrieval, and cryptography. In the context of algorithms and data structures, hashing typically refers to the process of mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes) using a hash function.

Here's a brief overview of hashing in C++:

#### Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input (or key) and produces a fixed-size output, typically a hash code. Good hash functions have the following properties:

1. Deterministic: For a given input, the output is always the same.
2. Fast: It should compute the hash code quickly.
3. Uniformity: The hash codes should be evenly distributed over the output range to minimize collisions.

In C++, you can implement hash functions using either built-in hash functions like `std::hash` or custom hash functions tailored to specific data types or requirements.

#### Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

##### Collision Handling

Collisions occur when two different keys hash to the same index. There are several techniques to handle collisions:

1. **Chaining**: Each bucket in the hash table is a linked list, and collisions are resolved by appending elements with the same hash code to the list.
2. **Open Addressing**: When a collision occurs, the algorithm looks for an alternative location within the table to place the item.
3. **Double Hashing**: It's a variation of open addressing where a second hash function is used to determine the next probe location when a collision occurs.

#### Example Implementation (Using Standard Library)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    // Create a hash table (unordered_map)
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Insert elements
    myMap["apple"] = 10;
    myMap["banana"] = 20;
    myMap["orange"] = 30;

    // Access elements
    std::cout << "apple: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "banana: " << myMap["banana"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "orange: " << myMap["orange"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::unordered_map` is used, which is a hash table implementation available in the C++ Standard Library.

Hashing is a vast topic with many nuances, and there are various advanced techniques and data structures built upon it, such as Bloom filters, cryptographic hashing, and more. Understanding hashing and its applications is essential for any programmer dealing with data storage and retrieval.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing in Primitives and GetHashCode

Hashing in algorithms and data structures, especially in C++, involves converting data (often of arbitrary size) into a fixed-size value or key. This process is essential for tasks like indexing, searching, and storing data efficiently. Let's delve into hashing primitives and the `GetHashCode` function in C++.

#### Hashing Primitives

1. **Integer Hashing**: For integer types, you can often use the integer itself as its hash value. If the integers are small and non-negative, they can be directly used as indices in an array.

    ```cpp
    int hash(int x) {
        return x; // Simplest hash function for integers
    }
    ```

2. **String Hashing**: Hashing strings involves converting each character into its ASCII value and combining them into a single hash value.

    ```cpp
    int hash(const std::string& str) {
        int hashValue = 0;
        for (char c : str) {
            hashValue = (hashValue * 31) + static_cast<int>(c); // Simple string hash
        }
        return hashValue;
    }
    ```

3. **Custom Types**: For custom types, you might need to implement a custom hash function. This often involves combining the hash values of its member variables.

    ```cpp
    struct Point {
        int x, y;
    };

    int hash(const Point& p) {
        return hash(p.x) ^ hash(p.y); // Combine hash values of x and y
    }
    ```

#### GetHashCode Function

In C++, the `GetHashCode` function is not a built-in feature like in languages such as C# or Java. However, you can implement similar functionality by overloading the `std::hash` template for your custom types.

```cpp
#include <functional>

struct MyType {
    int x, y;
};

namespace std {
    template<> struct hash<MyType> {
        size_t operator()(const MyType& obj) const {
            // Implement hash function for MyType
            return hash<int>()(obj.x) ^ hash<int>()(obj.y);
        }
    };
}

// Usage
MyType obj {10, 20};
size_t hashValue = std::hash<MyType>{}(obj);
```

#### Guidelines for Good Hash Functions

- **Uniformity**: A good hash function should distribute hash values uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions.
  
- **Determinism**: The hash function should return the same value for the same input consistently.

- **Efficiency**: The hash function should be computationally efficient.

- **Minimal Collisions**: Collisions (two different inputs mapping to the same hash value) should be minimized, though they are inevitable in practice.

Hashing is a crucial concept in computer science, facilitating efficient data retrieval and storage. Careful consideration of hash function design is essential for the effectiveness of hash-based algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing Problems

Hashing problems are common in computer science and require a good understanding of algorithms and data structures. Hashing involves converting data into a fixed-size value, typically for rapid data retrieval. In C++, you often use hashing in various scenarios, such as implementing hash tables, hash maps, or solving problems related to string manipulation.

Here are a few common hashing problems along with brief descriptions:

1. **Hash Map Implementation**: Implementing your own hash map (also known as a dictionary or associative array) using hashing techniques. This involves handling collisions, resizing, and efficient key-value pair retrieval.

2. **Hash Set Implementation**: Similar to hash map implementation, but with a focus on maintaining a set of unique elements and supporting operations like insertion, deletion, and membership checking.

3. **String Hashing**: Problems related to hashing strings, such as finding duplicate substrings, anagrams, or pattern matching. Techniques like Rabin-Karp algorithm for substring search or using a hash table to store counts of characters in a string can be used.

4. **Hashing for Data Integrity**: Applications where hashing is used for ensuring data integrity, such as checksum verification or detecting tampering in files.

5. **Hashing for Cryptography**: Utilizing hashing functions in cryptographic applications like password hashing, digital signatures, or generating cryptographic hashes.

6. **Collision Resolution Techniques**: Understanding and implementing collision resolution techniques like chaining (using linked lists to handle collisions) or open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, etc.).

7. **Counting and Frequency Problems**: Using hashing to efficiently count occurrences of elements in an array or stream, finding the most frequent element, or checking if two arrays are permutations of each other.

8. **Subarray Sum Equals K**: Given an array of integers, finding the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals a given target value K. Hashing can be used to efficiently solve this problem.

9. **Group Anagrams**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together. Hashing can be used to group strings that are anagrams of each other efficiently.

10. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. Hashing can be used to keep track of characters' positions.

These are just a few examples of the many problems where hashing can be applied. Understanding the underlying principles of hashing and its various applications is essential for tackling these types of problems effectively in C++ or any other programming language.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing STL

In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a powerful set of tools for working with data structures and algorithms. When it comes to hashing, the STL offers the `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` containers, which are implemented using hash tables.

Here's a brief overview of how to use these containers for hashing in C++:

1. **unordered_map**: This container is used to store key-value pairs. Each element is stored as a combination of a key and its corresponding value. The elements are not stored in any particular order, but rather are organized based on the hash value of the keys. You can use `unordered_map` when you need to quickly look up values based on their keys.

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting elements
    myMap["John"] = 28;
    myMap["Alice"] = 30;
    myMap["Bob"] = 25;

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "John's age is: " << myMap["John"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. **unordered_set**: This container is used to store unique elements, where each element must be unique. It is similar to `unordered_map`, but it only stores keys without any associated values. It's useful when you want to maintain a collection of unique elements and quickly check for membership.

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::unordered_set<std::string> mySet;

    // Inserting elements
    mySet.insert("apple");
    mySet.insert("banana");
    mySet.insert("orange");

    // Checking for membership
    if (mySet.find("banana") != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << "Found banana!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Both `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` provide constant time complexity (\(O(1)\)) for average-case operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup, making them very efficient for many applications.

Remember to include the appropriate header files (`#include <unordered_map>` and `#include <unordered_set>`) at the beginning of your code to use these containers. Additionally, ensure that you have enabled C++11 or later to use the unordered containers, as they are part of the C++11 standard.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing Technique

Hashing is a fundamental technique in computer science used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. It's widely used in various applications such as implementing hash tables, cryptographic hash functions, data retrieval, and more. In C++, hashing can be implemented using different methods, each with its advantages and use cases. Here's an overview of some hashing techniques commonly used in C++:

1. **Division Method**: This technique involves dividing the key value by the table size and taking the remainder as the hash value. It's simple and fast but may cause clustering if not implemented carefully.

```cpp
int hashFunction(int key, int tableSize) {
    return key % tableSize;
}
```

1. **Multiplication Method**: This method involves multiplying the key value by a constant (usually a fractional part) and extracting the fractional part of the product as the hash value.

```cpp
int hashFunction(int key, int tableSize) {
    const double A = 0.6180339887; // Fractional part of (√5 - 1) / 2
    double frac = key * A - floor(key * A);
    return static_cast<int>(frac * tableSize);
}
```

1. **Universal Hashing**: Universal hashing aims to minimize collisions by randomly selecting a hash function from a family of hash functions. This technique is useful in situations where the distribution of keys is unknown.

```cpp
int hashFunction(int key, int tableSize, int a, int b, int p) {
    return ((a * key + b) % p) % tableSize;
}
```

1. **Chaining**: Chaining is a collision resolution technique where each bucket in the hash table is a linked list of key-value pairs. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply appended to the linked list.

```cpp
class HashTable {
private:
    static const int tableSize = 10;
    list<pair<int, string>> table[tableSize];
public:
    void insert(int key, string value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(make_pair(key, value));
    }
    
    string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto& kv : table[index]) {
            if (kv.first == key)
                return kv.second;
        }
        return "Key not found";
    }
};
```

1. **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, collisions are resolved by finding an alternative position within the same hash table. Techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing are used for this purpose.

```cpp
class HashTable {
private:
    static const int tableSize = 10;
    pair<int, string> table[tableSize];
public:
    void insert(int key, string value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        while (table[index].first != INT_MIN) {
            index = (index + 1) % tableSize;
        }
        table[index] = make_pair(key, value);
    }
    
    string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        int originalIndex = index;
        do {
            if (table[index].first == key)
                return table[index].second;
            index = (index + 1) % tableSize;
        } while (index != originalIndex);
        return "Key not found";
    }
};
```

These are just a few examples of hashing techniques in C++. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may choose one technique over another.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing Terminology

Certainly! Here are some fundamental hashing terminologies in the context of algorithms and data structures in C++:

1. **Hash Function**: A function that converts a given input (or 'key') into a fixed-size value, typically a hash code. The output is used to index a hash table.

2. **Hash Table**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found.

3. **Collision**: A situation that occurs when two distinct inputs produce the same hash code or index. Collisions must be resolved to maintain the correctness of the hash table.

4. **Collision Resolution**: Techniques used to handle collisions that occur when two different keys hash to the same index in a hash table. Common approaches include chaining and open addressing.

5. **Chaining**: A method of collision resolution where each slot in the hash table corresponds to a linked list. Colliding elements are added to the linked list at the corresponding slot.

6. **Open Addressing**: A method of collision resolution where, upon a collision, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table. Linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing are common techniques used in open addressing.

7. **Load Factor**: A measure of how full the hash table is. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of elements stored in the hash table to the number of slots available. A higher load factor increases the likelihood of collisions.

8. **Rehashing**: The process of creating a new hash table with a larger size and moving all the elements from the old hash table to the new one. Rehashing is typically performed when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold to maintain efficient operations.

9. **Perfect Hash Function**: A hash function that generates a unique hash code for each distinct input, eliminating collisions entirely. Perfect hash functions are not always achievable, especially for general inputs.

10. **Cryptographic Hash Function**: A special type of hash function that is designed to be computationally difficult to reverse, providing a high level of security. Examples include SHA-256 and MD5.

Understanding these terminologies is crucial for designing, implementing, and analyzing algorithms and data structures that rely on hashing in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing Using Chaining as Collision resolution technique

Hashing using chaining is a popular technique to handle collisions in hash tables. In this method, each bucket in the hash table doesn't just store a single value, but instead, it maintains a linked list (or any other dynamic data structure like a vector or a tree) of all the values that hash to the same index. Here's how you can implement hashing using chaining in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
using namespace std;

// Class representing a hash table with chaining
class HashTable {
private:
    // Size of the hash table
    static const int tableSize = 10;
    // Array of linked lists to store elements
    list<int> table[tableSize];

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % tableSize;
    }

public:
    // Function to insert a key into the hash table
    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(key);
    }

    // Function to search for a key in the hash table
    bool search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        // Iterate through the linked list at the index
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (*it == key)
                return true; // Found
        }
        return false; // Not found
    }

    // Function to remove a key from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        // Iterate through the linked list at the index
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (*it == key) {
                table[index].erase(it); // Remove the key
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to display the hash table
    void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < tableSize; ++i) {
            cout << i << " : ";
            for (auto it = table[i].begin(); it != table[i].end(); ++it) {
                cout << *it << " -> ";
            }
            cout << "NULL" << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert(10);
    ht.insert(20);
    ht.insert(15);
    ht.insert(25);
    cout << "Hash Table after insertion:" << endl;
    ht.display();
    cout << "Searching for 20: " << (ht.search(20) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;
    cout << "Removing 15..." << endl;
    ht.remove(15);
    cout << "Hash Table after removal:" << endl;
    ht.display();
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code demonstrates the implementation of a hash table with chaining as the collision resolution technique. You can insert, search, and remove elements from the hash table. Each bucket in the hash table (`tableSize` number of buckets) is implemented as a linked list, where elements with the same hash value are stored together.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing Using Linear Probing as Collision resolution technique

Hashing with linear probing is a technique used to handle collisions in hash tables. When two keys hash to the same index, linear probing resolves the collision by searching sequentially through the table until an empty slot is found.

Here's an example of how you might implement hashing with linear probing in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;

class HashTable {
private:
    vector<int> table;
public:
    HashTable() {
        table.resize(TABLE_SIZE, -1); // Initialize table with -1 (indicating empty slot)
    }

    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE; // Simple hash function using modulo operator
    }

    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        while (table[index] != -1) { // Collision detected
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Move to next slot linearly
        }
        table[index] = key; // Insert the key into the table
    }

    void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; ++i) {
            if (table[i] != -1) {
                cout << "Index " << i << ": " << table[i] << endl;
            } else {
                cout << "Index " << i << ": Empty" << endl;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert(10);
    ht.insert(20);
    ht.insert(30);
    ht.insert(41); // Collision with 10
    ht.insert(51); // Collision with 20
    ht.display();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `HashTable` class contains a vector `table` to store the keys.
- `hashFunction` calculates the index for a given key.
- `insert` function inserts a key into the hash table using linear probing to resolve collisions.
- `display` function prints the contents of the hash table.

Linear probing is simple and efficient but can lead to clustering, where consecutive slots are filled, potentially reducing performance. Techniques like quadratic probing or chaining can be used to mitigate this issue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing vs Other Data Structures

In the realm of algorithms and data structures, hashing is a powerful technique used for various purposes, such as fast data retrieval, data indexing, and ensuring uniqueness. However, it's not the only technique available. Let's compare hashing with other data structures in terms of their characteristics, use cases, and advantages:

1. **Hashing**:
   - **Characteristics**: Hashing involves mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes) using a hash function. These hash codes are then used as indices to access elements in a data structure like a hash table.
   - **Use Cases**: Hashing is particularly useful for fast retrieval of data based on keys (e.g., dictionaries or associative arrays), implementing caches, and ensuring data uniqueness.
   - **Advantages**:
     - O(1) average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup in hash tables (assuming a good hash function).
     - Ideal for scenarios where quick access to data based on keys is required.

2. **Arrays**:
   - **Characteristics**: Arrays are a fundamental data structure consisting of a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. Elements are accessed using indices.
   - **Use Cases**: Arrays are suitable for scenarios where elements need to be accessed by their indices, and the size of the collection is fixed or can be determined in advance.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Direct access to elements using indices with O(1) time complexity.
     - Memory locality can lead to better cache performance.

3. **Linked Lists**:
   - **Characteristics**: Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Use Cases**: Linked lists are useful when frequent insertions and deletions are required, especially in scenarios where the size of the data structure is dynamic and unpredictable.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Efficient insertion and deletion operations (O(1) time complexity for insertions and deletions at the beginning or end of the list with proper references).
     - Dynamic size adjustment without needing to preallocate memory.

4. **Trees** (e.g., Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees):
   - **Characteristics**: Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has a value and references to its child nodes.
   - **Use Cases**: Trees are suitable for scenarios where data needs to be organized hierarchically or sorted, facilitating efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations (O(log n) time complexity in balanced trees).
     - Useful for scenarios requiring sorted data or hierarchical organization.

Each of these data structures has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Hashing excels in fast key-based retrieval and unique identification, while other data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees offer different advantages based on the nature of the operations and data organization needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Array Intersection

Array intersection involves finding the common elements between two arrays. One efficient way to solve this problem is by using hashing. Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    unordered_set<int> hashSet(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    vector<int> result;

    for (int num : nums2) {
        if (hashSet.count(num)) {
            result.push_back(num);
            hashSet.erase(num); // Avoid duplicates
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 2, 1};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2, 2};

    vector<int> intersection = intersect(nums1, nums2);

    cout << "Intersection: ";
    for (int num : intersection) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We first convert the elements of the first array (`nums1`) into a hash set for constant time lookups.
- Then, we iterate through the second array (`nums2`), checking if each element exists in the hash set. If it does, we add it to the result vector and remove it from the hash set to avoid duplicates.
- Finally, we return the result vector containing the intersection of the two arrays.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Built-In Dictionaries

In C++, the standard library provides a built-in hash table implementation called `std::unordered_map`, which is part of the `<unordered_map>` header. This data structure is typically implemented as a hash table, providing constant-time average complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations, though this is amortized.

Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of `std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Create an unordered_map with string keys and int values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting elements
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 3;
    myMap["orange"] = 2;

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "Value of apple: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Iterating over the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    // Checking if a key exists
    if (myMap.find("banana") != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Found banana!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Deleting an element
    myMap.erase("orange");

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates basic operations such as insertion, access, iteration, and deletion in an `unordered_map`. Just include `<unordered_map>` header, and you're good to go. This data structure is very efficient for associative array lookups when the keys are not required to be sorted. However, it's important to note that hash table performance can degrade if there are too many collisions or if the hash function is not well-distributed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Chaining

Hashing with chaining is a technique used to implement hash tables, which are data structures that store key-value pairs and allow for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. In this technique, collisions (when two different keys hash to the same index) are resolved by maintaining a linked list of elements at each index of the hash table.

Here's a basic outline of how hashing with chaining works in C++:

1. **Hash Function**: You need a hash function that converts keys into array indices. This function should ideally distribute keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions.

2. **Linked List**: Define a linked list structure to handle collisions. Each element in the linked list represents a key-value pair.

3. **Hash Table**: Define the hash table, which is an array of linked lists. Each index of the array corresponds to a bucket, and each bucket contains a linked list of key-value pairs.

4. **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair into the hash table, first hash the key to find the appropriate index in the array. Then, insert the pair at the beginning or end of the linked list at that index.

5. **Search**: To search for a key in the hash table, hash the key to find the index and traverse the linked list at that index to find the key-value pair.

6. **Deletion**: To delete a key from the hash table, hash the key to find the index and traverse the linked list at that index to find and remove the key-value pair.

Here's a simple implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

class HashTable {
private:
    static const int tableSize = 10;
    std::list<std::pair<int, std::string>> table[tableSize]; // Array of linked lists

    // Hash function
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % tableSize;
    }

public:
    // Insertion
    void insert(int key, std::string value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }

    // Search
    std::string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (const auto& entry : table[index]) {
            if (entry.first == key)
                return entry.second; // Return value associated with key
        }
        return "Key not found";
    }

    // Deletion
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                table[index].erase(it); // Remove key-value pair
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable hashTable;

    // Insertion
    hashTable.insert(10, "Alice");
    hashTable.insert(25, "Bob");
    hashTable.insert(7, "Charlie");

    // Search
    std::cout << "Value associated with key 10: " << hashTable.search(10) << std::endl;

    // Deletion
    hashTable.remove(25);
    std::cout << "Value associated with key 25: " << hashTable.search(25) << std::endl; // Should print "Key not found"

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates basic operations such as insertion, search, and deletion using hashing with chaining in C++. The `HashTable` class defines an array of linked lists, and the `insert`, `search`, and `remove` methods implement the corresponding operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Collision Handling

In hashing, collision handling refers to the techniques used to deal with situations where two different keys hash to the same index in a hash table. Here are some common collision handling techniques in hashing:

1. **Chaining**:
   - In chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the colliding elements are simply added to the linked list corresponding to that index.
   - Retrieval involves hashing the key to find the correct bucket and then searching the linked list for the key.

2. **Open Addressing**:
   - In open addressing, when a collision occurs, an alternative location in the hash table is searched to place the colliding element.
   - Linear Probing: In linear probing, if a collision occurs at index `i`, the algorithm checks index `i+1`, then `i+2`, and so on until an empty slot is found.
   - Quadratic Probing: In quadratic probing, the algorithm checks indices that are quadratic functions of the original index.
   - Double Hashing: In double hashing, an alternative hash function is used to calculate the step size for probing.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**:
   - In Robin Hood hashing, when a new element wants to be inserted and encounters a collision, it displaces the element that has traveled farthest from its original position in the probing sequence.
   - This method aims to minimize the variance in the number of probes required for successful retrieval.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**:
   - In cuckoo hashing, each key can be placed in one of two possible locations. If a key's primary location is occupied, it is moved to its secondary location.
   - This process can lead to a chain reaction where multiple keys need to be rehashed until all find a place to settle.

5. **Coalesced Hashing**:
   - In coalesced hashing, instead of storing the collided elements in separate linked lists (as in chaining), they are stored in one large array with auxiliary data structures to handle collisions.
   - When a collision occurs, the collided element and the element already at that index form a cluster that is stored together elsewhere in the array.

Each collision handling technique has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the expected distribution of keys, memory constraints, and the desired efficiency of insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Hash Functions

Hash functions are fundamental components in computer science, particularly in the realm of algorithms and data structures. They play a crucial role in hashing, a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically for efficient storage, retrieval, and comparison. In C++, hash functions are often implemented for use in hash tables, unordered maps, sets, and other associative containers.

Here's an overview of hash functions in C++:

### Purpose of Hash Functions

1. **Efficient Lookup:** Hash functions enable constant-time (O(1)) retrieval of data by computing a fixed-size hash value from the original data.
2. **Data Integrity:** Hash functions are used in data integrity checks, ensuring that data has not been altered or corrupted during transmission or storage.
3. **Security:** In cryptographic applications, hash functions are employed for generating hash codes and digital signatures, providing data security and integrity.

### Characteristics of Good Hash Functions

1. **Deterministic:** For the same input, a hash function should always produce the same output.
2. **Uniformity:** The output should be uniformly distributed over the hash space, reducing collisions.
3. **Efficiency:** Hash functions should be computationally efficient to minimize overhead.
4. **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input should result in a significantly different hash value.
5. **Preimage Resistance:** Given a hash value, it should be computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original input.
6. **Collision Resistance:** It should be difficult to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

### Commonly Used Hash Functions in C++

1. **std::hash:** This is a generic hash function provided by the C++ Standard Library, suitable for hashing primitive types and standard library containers.

   Example:

   ```cpp
   std::hash<std::string> hasher;
   size_t hashValue = hasher("Hello");
   ```

2. **Custom Hash Functions:** For user-defined types, custom hash functions need to be implemented. This often involves combining hash values of individual members or properties using bitwise operations like XOR (^) or addition (+).

   Example:

   ```cpp
   struct MyStructHash {
       size_t operator()(const MyStruct& obj) const {
           size_t hashValue = std::hash<int>()(obj.someInteger);
           hashValue ^= std::hash<std::string>()(obj.someString) + 0x9e3779b9 + (hashValue << 6) + (hashValue >> 2);
           return hashValue;
       }
   };
   ```

3. **Cryptographic Hash Functions:** When security is a concern, cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 or MD5 are used. These provide strong collision resistance and preimage resistance.

   Example (using third-party libraries like OpenSSL or Crypto++):

   ```cpp
   #include <openssl/sha.h>
   
   std::string computeSHA256(const std::string& input) {
       unsigned char hash[SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH];
       SHA256_CTX sha256;
       SHA256_Init(&sha256);
       SHA256_Update(&sha256, input.c_str(), input.length());
       SHA256_Final(hash, &sha256);
       std::stringstream ss;
       for (int i = 0; i < SHA256_DIGEST_LENGTH; i++) {
           ss << std::hex << std::setw(2) << std::setfill('0') << (int)hash[i];
       }
       return ss.str();
   }
   ```

Hash functions are a cornerstone of many algorithms and data structures, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data in various applications. Understanding their properties and implementing them effectively is essential for developing robust software systems.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Hashtable Implementation

Implementing a hashtable in C++ involves creating a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Here's a basic implementation of a hashtable using chaining for collision resolution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Hash function to convert keys into array indices
int hashFunction(int key, int size) {
    return key % size;
}

// Hashtable class
class Hashtable {
private:
    int size;
    vector

```cpp
    <list<int>> table; // vector of linked lists

public:
    Hashtable(int size) : size(size) {
        table.resize(size);
    }

    // Insert key into the hashtable
    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key, size);
        table[index].push_back(key);
    }

    // Search for key in the hashtable
    bool search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key, size);
        auto& list = table[index];
        return find(list.begin(), list.end(), key) != list.end();
    }

    // Delete key from the hashtable
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key, size);
        auto& list = table[index];
        list.remove(key);
    }
};

int main() {
    Hashtable ht(10); // Create a hashtable of size 10
    ht.insert(5);
    ht.insert(15);
    ht.insert(25);

    cout << "Searching for 5: " << (ht.search(5) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;
    cout << "Searching for 10: " << (ht.search(10) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;

    ht.remove(5);
    cout << "Searching for 5 after removal: " << (ht.search(5) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a hash function (`hashFunction`) that maps keys to indices in the array/vector.
- The `Hashtable` class contains a vector of linked lists. Each linked list represents a chain of elements that have the same hash value.
- `insert` function inserts a key into the appropriate linked list.
- `search` function searches for a key in the hashtable.
- `remove` function removes a key from the hashtable.

This implementation uses chaining for handling collisions. When multiple keys hash to the same index, they are stored in the same linked list.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: K-Sum Subarray

K-Sum Subarray problem involves finding subarrays whose elements sum up to a given value K. This problem can be efficiently solved using hashing in C++.

Here's a basic implementation using hashing:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int countKSumSubarrays(const vector<int>& nums, int K) {
    unordered_map<int, int> hash_map;
    int sum = 0, count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        sum += nums[i];
        if (sum == K)
            count++;
        if (hash_map.find(sum - K) != hash_map.end())
            count += hash_map[sum - K];
        hash_map[sum]++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2};
    int K = 7;
    cout << "Number of subarrays with sum " << K << ": " << countKSumSubarrays(nums, K) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We use an unordered_map to store the cumulative sum of elements encountered so far along with their frequencies.
- As we traverse through the array, at each index, we update the cumulative sum.
- If the current sum equals K, we increment the count.
- If there exists a sum seen before such that the difference between the current sum and that sum equals K, we increment the count by the frequency of that sum.
- Finally, we update the hash_map with the current sum's frequency.
- We return the count of subarrays with the desired sum K.

This implementation runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the size of the input array.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Linear Probing

Linear probing is a technique used in hashing to resolve collisions, which occur when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. In linear probing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available (empty) slot in the table by linearly probing through the table until an empty slot is found.

Here's a basic implementation of linear probing in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;

class HashTable {
private:
    vector<int> table;
    vector<bool> isOccupied;

    // Hash function
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    HashTable() {
        table.resize(TABLE_SIZE, -1); // Initialize table with -1 indicating empty slot
        isOccupied.resize(TABLE_SIZE, false); // Initialize occupancy status
    }

    // Insert key into hash table
    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);

        // Linear probing
        while (isOccupied[index]) {
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Move to the next slot
        }

        // Insert key into the found empty slot
        table[index] = key;
        isOccupied[index] = true;
    }

    // Search for key in hash table
    bool search(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);

        // Linear probing to find the key
        while (isOccupied[index]) {
            if (table[index] == key) {
                return true; // Key found
            }
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Move to the next slot
        }

        return false; // Key not found
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;

    // Insert some keys
    ht.insert(5);
    ht.insert(15);
    ht.insert(25);

    // Search for keys
    cout << "Search 15: " << (ht.search(15) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    cout << "Search 25: " << (ht.search(25) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    cout << "Search 35: " << (ht.search(35) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `HashTable` class represents the hash table.
- `table` is a vector storing the keys.
- `isOccupied` is a vector indicating whether each slot in the table is occupied.
- `hash` function calculates the hash value of the key.
- `insert` function inserts a key into the hash table using linear probing.
- `search` function searches for a key in the hash table using linear probing.

Linear probing can lead to clustering, where consecutive slots are filled, causing longer search times. To mitigate this, other probing techniques like quadratic probing or double hashing can be used.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Open Addressing: Basics

Open addressing is a technique used in hashing to resolve collisions. In open addressing, when a collision occurs (i.e., when two keys hash to the same location), the algorithm probes for other locations in the hash table until an empty slot is found.

Here are some basics of open addressing in C++:

1. **Linear Probing**: In linear probing, if a collision occurs at position `h(key)`, the algorithm probes the next position (`h(key) + 1`), then the next (`h(key) + 2`), and so on, until an empty slot is found.

   ```cpp
   int hash(int key, int size) {
       return key % size; // Assuming simple modulo hashing
   }

   void insert(int key, int table[], int size) {
       int index = hash(key, size);
       while (table[index] != -1) {
           index = (index + 1) % size; // Linear probing
       }
       table[index] = key;
   }
   ```

2. **Quadratic Probing**: In quadratic probing, the step size increases quadratically after each collision. This helps to avoid clustering.

   ```cpp
   void insert(int key, int table[], int size) {
       int index = hash(key, size);
       int i = 1;
       while (table[index] != -1) {
           index = (index + i * i) % size; // Quadratic probing
           i++;
       }
       table[index] = key;
   }
   ```

3. **Double Hashing**: In double hashing, a second hash function is used to determine the probe sequence. It typically involves finding an increment value `h2(key)` and using it to step through the table.

   ```cpp
   int hash2(int key) {
       // Secondary hash function
       // Ensure it doesn't return 0
       return (prime - (key % prime)); 
   }

   void insert(int key, int table[], int size) {
       int index = hash(key, size);
       int offset = hash2(key); // Determine the step size
       while (table[index] != -1) {
           index = (index + offset) % size; // Double hashing
       }
       table[index] = key;
   }
   ```

4. **Deletion**: Deletion in open addressing requires special handling to mark deleted elements and distinguish them from empty slots. This is usually done by marking the deleted slots in some way, such as setting them to a special value like `-2`.

Remember, when implementing open addressing, it's important to consider load factor, table resizing, and collision resolution strategies to maintain efficiency.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Open Addressing: Double Hashing

Double hashing is a technique used in open addressing schemes to resolve collisions in hash tables. In open addressing, when a collision occurs (i.e., two keys hash to the same index), instead of immediately placing the item into the table, we probe or search for another empty slot in the table to place the item. Double hashing uses two hash functions to determine the probe sequence.

Here's how it works:

1. **Hash Functions**: Double hashing requires two different hash functions. Let's call them `hash1(key)` and `hash2(key)`.

2. **Primary Hash Function**: The primary hash function `hash1(key)` maps the key to an index in the hash table. If this slot is occupied, we move to the next step.

3. **Secondary Hash Function**: The secondary hash function `hash2(key)` is used to determine the step size or increment for probing. It should be designed in such a way that it returns a relatively prime number with the size of the hash table to avoid clustering.

4. **Probing Sequence**: Starting from the index calculated by `hash1(key)`, if the slot is occupied, we probe with increments determined by `hash2(key)` until an empty slot is found.

5. **Insertion**: When inserting a key, we calculate the initial index with `hash1(key)`, then use `hash2(key)` to find the step size for probing. If the initial index is occupied, we probe with steps determined by `hash2(key)` until an empty slot is found, then place the key there.

6. **Searching and Deletion**: Searching and deletion also follow the same probe sequence until the key is found or an empty slot is encountered (indicating the key is not present).

Here's a simple example of how double hashing might be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class HashTable {
private:
    std::vector<int> table;
    int capacity;
    
    // Primary hash function
    int hash1(int key) {
        return key % capacity;
    }
    
    // Secondary hash function
    int hash2(int key) {
        // Here, we choose a prime number smaller than capacity
        return 7 - (key % 7);
    }

public:
    HashTable(int size) {
        capacity = size;
        table.resize(capacity, -1); // -1 indicates empty slot
    }
    
    // Function to insert a key into the hash table
    void insert(int key) {
        int index = hash1(key);
        int step = hash2(key);
        
        while (table[index] != -1) {
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }
        table[index] = key;
    }
    
    // Function to search for a key in the hash table
    bool search(int key) {
        int index = hash1(key);
        int step = hash2(key);
        
        while (table[index] != key && table[index] != -1) {
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }
        
        return table[index] == key;
    }
    
    // Function to delete a key from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash1(key);
        int step = hash2(key);
        
        while (table[index] != key && table[index] != -1) {
            index = (index + step) % capacity;
        }
        
        if (table[index] == key)
            table[index] = -1; // Mark the slot as empty
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable hash_table(10); // Create a hash table with size 10
    
    // Insert some keys
    hash_table.insert(5);
    hash_table.insert(25);
    hash_table.insert(15);
    hash_table.insert(35);
    
    // Search for a key
    std::cout << "Key 15 found: " << std::boolalpha << hash_table.search(15) << std::endl;
    
    // Remove a key
    hash_table.remove(25);
    
    // Search for the removed key
    std::cout << "Key 25 found: " << std::boolalpha << hash_table.search(25) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple implementation of a hash table using double hashing for collision resolution. The `insert`, `search`, and `remove` functions use double hashing to handle collisions and perform the necessary operations on the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Open Addressing: Linear Probing

In hashing, open addressing is a technique used to handle collisions, which occur when multiple keys are hashed to the same index. Linear probing is one of the methods used within open addressing to resolve these collisions.

Here's how linear probing works:

1. **Hashing**: Each key is hashed to an index in the hash table. The hash function maps keys to indices in the array.

2. **Insertion**: When inserting a new key-value pair, if the calculated index is already occupied by another key-value pair, linear probing comes into play.

3. **Collision Handling**: If there's a collision at the calculated index, linear probing searches sequentially through the array (in a linear manner) until it finds an empty slot (an index with no key-value pair). It then inserts the new key-value pair into that empty slot.

4. **Search**: During search operations, when looking for a key, if the calculated index doesn't match the desired key, the algorithm continues searching linearly through the array until it either finds the key or encounters an empty slot (indicating that the key isn't present in the table).

5. **Deletion**: Deleting a key-value pair can be a bit tricky with linear probing. Typically, you don't remove the key-value pair directly; instead, you mark it as deleted or simply set it to a special value indicating that it's no longer valid. This is because removing a key-value pair might break the linear probing sequence and make it difficult to find other elements.

Linear probing has its pros and cons. It's simple to implement and doesn't require additional data structures like linked lists. However, it can suffer from clustering, where consecutive insertions lead to clusters of occupied slots, causing longer search times. To mitigate this, various techniques like double hashing or quadratic probing are used. These methods alter the linear sequence to distribute keys more evenly across the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Open Addressing: Quadratic Probing

Quadratic probing is a technique used in open addressing schemes for resolving collisions in hash tables. In open addressing, when a collision occurs (i.e., when two different keys hash to the same index), quadratic probing aims to find the next available slot by incrementing the hash index using a quadratic function until an empty slot is found.

Here's how it works:

1. **Hash Function**: You start by hashing the key to get an initial index in the hash table.

2. **Collision Handling**: If the computed index is already occupied by another key, instead of just moving linearly (adding 1, then 2, then 3, and so on) to find the next available slot, quadratic probing uses a quadratic function to determine the next probe location.

   The general formula for quadratic probing is:

   ```bash
   hash(key, i) = (hash(key) + i^2) % table_size
   ```

   Here, `hash(key)` is the initial hash index, `i` is the probe number (starting from 0), and `table_size` is the size of the hash table.

3. **Incrementing Quadratically**: Instead of adding a fixed value to the hash index for each probe, you add increasing square numbers to it. This quadratic increment is key to reducing clustering and the formation of long probe sequences, which can degrade performance.

4. **Finding an Empty Slot**: You continue probing until you find an empty slot (`NULL` in C++) or until you've probed the entire table.

5. **Insertion and Search**: During insertion, you look for an empty slot using quadratic probing and insert the key there. During search operations, you also use quadratic probing to locate the key.

6. **Deletion**: Deletion in quadratic probing is a bit more complex than insertion and search because if you simply mark a slot as deleted, it can interfere with subsequent searches. Some methods involve marking the slot as deleted and then performing a rehashing if necessary.

However, quadratic probing has its drawbacks. It can suffer from clustering, where consecutive insertions and probes tend to cluster around certain areas of the hash table, leading to poor performance. Additionally, quadratic probing might not visit every slot in the table, leading to some slots being more likely to be probed than others.

Despite its limitations, quadratic probing is relatively simple to implement and often provides better performance than linear probing in many scenarios.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Quadratic Probing

Quadratic probing is a technique used in hashing to resolve collisions. When a collision occurs (i.e., when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table), quadratic probing searches for an empty slot in the hash table by incrementing the hash index by quadratic increments until an empty slot is found.

Here's a basic overview of how quadratic probing works:

1. **Hash Function**: Keys are hashed to determine their index in the hash table.

2. **Collision**: If two keys hash to the same index, a collision occurs.

3. **Quadratic Probing**: Instead of just linearly probing the next slot, quadratic probing increments the index by quadratic increments. The quadratic increment is calculated using a quadratic function, typically of the form \( f(i) = i^2 \), where \( i \) is the number of probes.

4. **Rehashing**: If a collision occurs during probing, the probing sequence continues until an empty slot is found.

5. **Load Factor**: It's essential to monitor the load factor of the hash table (the ratio of the number of elements to the table size). If the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash table should be resized and rehashed to maintain performance.

Below is a basic example of a hash table implementation in C++ using quadratic probing:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

const int TABLE_SIZE = 11; // Size of the hash table

class HashTable {
private:
    vector<pair<string, int>> table; // Vector of pairs to store key-value pairs

    // Hash function to calculate the index
    int hashFunction(const string& key) {
        int hash = 0;
        for (char c : key) {
            hash = (hash * 31 + c) % TABLE_SIZE; // A simple hash function
        }
        return hash;
    }

public:
    HashTable() : table(TABLE_SIZE) {}

    // Insert key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(const string& key, int value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        int i = 0;
        while (!table[index].first.empty()) { // Probe until an empty slot is found
            // Quadratic increment
            index = (index + i * i) % TABLE_SIZE;
            i++;
        }
        table[index] = make_pair(key, value);
    }

    // Search for a key in the hash table
    int search(const string& key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        int i = 0;
        while (table[index].first != key && !table[index].first.empty()) {
            // Quadratic increment
            index = (index + i * i) % TABLE_SIZE;
            i++;
        }
        if (table[index].first == key)
            return table[index].second;
        return -1; // Key not found
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert("John", 25);
    ht.insert("Jane", 30);
    ht.insert("Bob", 40);

    cout << "Age of John: " << ht.search("John") << endl;
    cout << "Age of Jane: " << ht.search("Jane") << endl;
    cout << "Age of Bob: " << ht.search("Bob") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the hash function is a simple one for illustration purposes. In practice, you would typically use a more sophisticated hash function. The hash table size (`TABLE_SIZE`) is chosen to be a prime number to reduce the likelihood of clustering.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Resolving Collisions

In hashing, collisions occur when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. There are several techniques to resolve collisions in hashing. Here are some common ones:

1. **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the colliding elements are stored in the same bucket as a linked list. This way, multiple elements can be stored at the same index in the hash table without any issues.

2. **Open Addressing**: Open addressing means that all elements are stored directly within the hash table itself, without using any auxiliary data structure like linked lists. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for an alternative location in the hash table to store the colliding element. There are several strategies for open addressing:
   - **Linear Probing**: If a collision occurs at index `i`, search for the next available (empty) slot by linearly probing through the table (`i+1`, `i+2`, etc.).
   - **Quadratic Probing**: Similar to linear probing, but the probing sequence follows a quadratic function. For example, if a collision occurs at index `i`, the next probes are at `i+1^2`, `i+2^2`, `i+3^2`, etc.
   - **Double Hashing**: Use a second hash function to calculate the step size for probing. If a collision occurs at index `i`, probe `i + h(key)`, where `h(key)` is the result of the secondary hash function.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variant of open addressing where elements are moved around to reduce the variance of the probe sequence length. When inserting, if a new element has to be inserted in a bucket whose displacement (distance from its initial hashed position) is smaller than that of the element being inserted, it swaps places with the new element.

Each collision resolution technique has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the expected number of elements, the distribution of the keys, and the desired performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Separate Chaining

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science that allows for efficient data retrieval. Separate chaining is a technique used in hashing to handle collisions, which occur when two or more keys hash to the same index in the hash table. Here's how it works in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

// Class representing a hash table using separate chaining
class HashTable {
private:
    // Number of buckets in the hash table
    int buckets;
    
    // Array of lists to store the key-value pairs
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<int, int>>> table;
    
    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % buckets;
    }
    
public:
    // Constructor to initialize the hash table with a specified number of buckets
    HashTable(int b) : buckets(b), table(b) {}
    
    // Function to insert a key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(int key, int value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }
    
    // Function to search for a key in the hash table and return its corresponding value
    int search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (const auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return pair.second;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }
    
    // Function to remove a key-value pair from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        auto& list = table[index];
        for (auto it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); ++it) {
            if ((*it).first == key) {
                list.erase(it);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Function to display the contents of the hash table
    void display() {
        for (int i = 0; i < buckets; ++i) {
            std::cout << "Bucket " << i << ": ";
            for (const auto& pair : table[i]) {
                std::cout << "[" << pair.first << ", " << pair.second << "] ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht(10); // Create a hash table with 10 buckets
    
    // Insert some key-value pairs
    ht.insert(1, 10);
    ht.insert(2, 20);
    ht.insert(3, 30);
    ht.insert(4, 40);
    
    // Display the contents of the hash table
    ht.display();
    
    // Search for a key and display its corresponding value
    std::cout << "Value for key 2: " << ht.search(2) << std::endl;
    
    // Remove a key-value pair
    ht.remove(3);
    
    // Display the updated contents of the hash table
    ht.display();
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create a hash table using separate chaining to handle collisions. The `HashTable` class has methods for insertion, searching, and removal of key-value pairs, as well as a method to display the contents of the hash table. The hash function used here simply takes the remainder of the key divided by the number of buckets to determine the index where the key-value pair should be stored.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Types of Collision Resolution Techniques

In hashing, collisions occur when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. Collision resolution techniques are methods used to handle these collisions. In C++, there are several common collision resolution techniques:

1. **Separate Chaining**:
   - In separate chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply appended to the linked list at the corresponding bucket.
   - It's relatively easy to implement and allows for an unlimited number of elements to be stored, as long as memory is available.
   - However, it can have performance issues if the hash function produces many collisions, as it requires traversing a linked list to find an element.

2. **Open Addressing**:
   - In open addressing, all elements are stored within the hash table itself. When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the table.
   - There are several variants of open addressing:
     - **Linear Probing**: If a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot linearly until an empty slot is found.
     - **Quadratic Probing**: Similar to linear probing, but the interval between probes is increased quadratically.
     - **Double Hashing**: In this technique, a second hash function is used to calculate the interval between probes.
   - Open addressing can be more memory-efficient than separate chaining, especially when the load factor is low.
   - However, it requires careful implementation to handle scenarios like clustering (where consecutive slots are filled) which can degrade performance.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**:
   - Robin Hood hashing is a variation of open addressing that aims to reduce clustering.
   - When inserting a new element, it compares the displacement (the distance between the intended bucket and the current bucket) with the displacement of the element already in the bucket.
   - If the new element has a smaller displacement, it swaps positions with the existing element and continues the process recursively.
   - This technique aims to balance the distribution of elements in the hash table, reducing the average search time.

Each collision resolution technique has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on factors such as the expected number of elements, memory constraints, and performance requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashing: Unordered Maps & Unordered Sets

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various applications, including algorithms and data structures. In C++, unordered maps and unordered sets are implementations of hash tables provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's a brief overview:

### Unordered Map (`std::unordered_map`)

An unordered map is a container that stores elements formed by a combination of a key and a mapped value. It provides fast access to individual elements using keys. The elements are not ordered in any particular sequence, but they are organized based on the hash value of the keys, which provides constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations on average.

Here's a basic example of using unordered_map in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting elements
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 3;
    myMap["orange"] = 7;

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "Number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Iterating over elements
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Unordered Set (`std::unordered_set`)

An unordered set is a container that stores unique elements, allowing for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion operations based on the element's hash value. Unlike a set, the elements are not ordered, and duplicates are not allowed.

Here's a basic example of using unordered_set in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    std::unordered_set<int> mySet;

    // Inserting elements
    mySet.insert(5);
    mySet.insert(3);
    mySet.insert(7);

    // Checking if an element exists
    if (mySet.find(5) != mySet.end()) {
        std::cout << "5 is in the set" << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterating over elements
    for (const auto& elem : mySet) {
        std::cout << elem << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Advantages

- **Fast Lookup**: Hash tables provide constant-time average-case performance for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **Versatility**: Unordered maps and sets can store any data type as keys or elements, as long as a hash function and comparison function are defined for the type.

### Considerations

- **Hash Collisions**: Hash tables may suffer from collisions, where two different keys have the same hash value. Collision resolution strategies, such as chaining or open addressing, are used to handle collisions efficiently.
- **Hash Function Quality**: The performance of hash tables depends on the quality of the hash function. A good hash function should distribute keys uniformly across the hash table to minimize collisions.

In C++, the STL provides default hash functions for basic data types, but custom hash functions may be required for user-defined types.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap Implementation - Delete & Search

Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of a HashMap in C++ with functions for insertion, deletion, and searching. We'll use separate chaining for handling collisions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

using namespace std;

// Node for the linked list

struct Node {
    K key;
    V value;

};

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap Implementation - Insert

Sure, here's a basic implementation of a hash map in C++ with an insert function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

// Define a class for the hash map
template <typename KeyType, typename ValueType, typename Hash = std::hash<KeyType>>
class HashMap {
private:
    // Define a bucket as a list of pairs
    typedef std::pair<KeyType, ValueType> KeyValuePair;
    typedef std::list<KeyValuePair> Bucket;
    
    // Number of buckets in the hash map
    static const size_t num_buckets = 100; // Adjust as needed
    
    // Vector of buckets
    std::vector<Bucket> buckets;

    // Hash function
    Hash hash_fn;

    // Get the bucket index for a key
    size_t get_bucket_index(const KeyType& key) const {
        return hash_fn(key) % num_buckets;
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    HashMap() : buckets(num_buckets) {}

    // Insert a key-value pair into the hash map
    void insert(const KeyType& key, const ValueType& value) {
        size_t bucket_index = get_bucket_index(key);
        Bucket& bucket = buckets[bucket_index];
        
        // Check if key already exists, if so, update the value
        for (auto& pair : bucket) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                pair.second = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        
        // Key doesn't exist, insert new key-value pair
        bucket.emplace_back(key, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    HashMap<std::string, int> map;
    map.insert("apple", 5);
    map.insert("banana", 7);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This is a simple implementation of a hash map using separate chaining for handling collisions. It uses a vector of lists (`std::vector<std::list>`) to store the key-value pairs. The `insert` function computes the hash of the key, determines the bucket index, and inserts the key-value pair into the appropriate bucket.

You can adjust the number of buckets (`num_buckets`) and choose a different hash function according to your requirements. Additionally, you might want to implement other functions such as retrieval, deletion, and resizing based on your needs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap Implementation Delete & Search

Sure, I can provide you with a simple implementation of a hash map in C++ that includes methods for insertion, deletion, and searching. Here's a basic implementation using chaining for collision resolution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <utility>

// HashNode class to store key-value pairs
template<typename K, typename V>
class HashNode {
public:
    K key;
    V value;
    HashNode(K key, V value) : key(key), value(value) {}
};

// HashMap class
template<typename K, typename V>
class HashMap {
private:
    int capacity; // capacity of the hash table
    std::vector<std::list



<std::pair<K, V>>> table; // hash table implemented as vector of lists of key-value pairs
    int size; // current size of the hash table

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    int hashFunction(const K& key) {
        return std::hash<K>()(key) % capacity;
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    HashMap(int capacity) : capacity(capacity), size(0) {
        table.resize(capacity);
    }

    // Insert key-value pair into the hash map
    void insert(const K& key, const V& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto& node : table[index]) {
            if (node.first == key) {
                // Update value if key already exists
                node.second = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        // Insert new key-value pair
        table[index].emplace_back(key, value);
        ++size;
    }

    // Delete key-value pair from the hash map
    void erase(const K& key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                table[index].erase(it);
                --size;
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Search for a key in the hash map
    bool search(const K& key, V& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto& node : table[index]) {
            if (node.first == key) {
                value = node.second;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the hash map is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return size == 0;
    }

    // Get the current size of the hash map
    int getSize() {
        return size;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    HashMap<std::string, int> hashMap(10);

    hashMap.insert("apple", 10);
    hashMap.insert("banana", 20);
    hashMap.insert("cherry", 30);

    int value;
    if (hashMap.search("banana", value)) {
        std::cout << "Value of banana: " << value << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Key 'banana' not found!" << std::endl;
    }

    hashMap.erase("banana");

    if (hashMap.search("banana", value)) {
        std::cout << "Value of banana: " << value << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Key 'banana' not found!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `HashMap` class uses a vector of lists to implement chaining for collision resolution.
- The `insert` method inserts a new key-value pair into the hash map. If the key already exists, it updates the corresponding value.
- The `erase` method deletes a key-value pair from the hash map based on the key.
- The `search` method searches for a key in the hash map and returns true if found, along with the corresponding value.
- The `isEmpty` method checks if the hash map is empty, and `getSize` returns the current size of the hash map.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap Implementation Insert

Sure, implementing a HashMap in C++ can be a great exercise in understanding data structures and algorithms. Here's a basic implementation of a HashMap including the `insert` operation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

// Define a structure for key-value pairs
template<typename K, typename V>
struct KeyValuePair {
    K key;
    V value;
    KeyValuePair(const K& k, const V& v) : key(k), value(v) {}
};

// Define the HashMap class
template<typename K, typename V, typename Hash = std::hash<K>>
class HashMap {
private:
    // Define the bucket as a list of KeyValuePairs
    typedef std::list<KeyValuePair<K, V>> Bucket;
    // Define the table as a vector of buckets
    std::vector<Bucket> table;
    // Hash function
    Hash hash;
    // Number of elements in the HashMap
    size_t size;

    // Helper function to get the index of a key
    size_t getIndex(const K& key) const {
        return hash(key) % table.size();
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    HashMap(size_t initialSize = 10) : table(initialSize), size(0) {}

    // Insert operation
    void insert(const K& key, const V& value) {
        // Get the index for the key
        size_t index = getIndex(key);
        // Iterate over the bucket at the index
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            // If the key already exists, update the value
            if (pair.key == key) {
                pair.value = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        // If the key doesn't exist, add a new key-value pair
        table[index].push_back(KeyValuePair<K, V>(key, value));
        ++size;
    }

    // Other operations (not implemented here)
    // - Search
    // - Delete
    // - Resize
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    HashMap<std::string, int> map;
    map.insert("one", 1);
    map.insert("two", 2);
    map.insert("three", 3);

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple HashMap class that uses separate chaining for collision resolution. It implements the `insert` operation to add key-value pairs to the HashMap. The hash function used here is `std::hash<K>`, which is the default hash function provided by the C++ standard library. You can customize the hash function by providing your own hash function object as a template argument to the HashMap class.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Bucket Array & Hash Function

Sure, let's dive into implementing a basic HashMap in C++. A HashMap typically consists of two main components: a bucket array and a hash function.

1. **Bucket Array**: This is an array where each element is a linked list (or some other data structure) to handle collisions. When multiple keys hash to the same index, they are stored in the linked list associated with that index.

2. **Hash Function**: This is a function that maps keys to indices in the bucket array. It should uniformly distribute keys across the array to minimize collisions.

Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

template<typename K, typename V>
class HashMap {
private:
    // Define a node structure for the linked list in each bucket
    struct Node {
        K key;
        V value;
        Node(K k, V v) : key(k), value(v) {}
    };

    // Define the bucket array
    std::vector<std::list<Node>> buckets;
    size_t capacity;

    // Hash function to map keys to indices
    size_t hash(const K& key) const {
        // Simple hash function for demonstration purposes
        // You may want to replace this with a better hash function
        return std::hash<K>()(key) % capacity;
    }

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the HashMap with a given capacity
    HashMap(size_t cap) : capacity(cap), buckets(cap) {}

    // Insert a key-value pair into the HashMap
    void insert(const K& key, const V& value) {
        size_t index = hash(key);
        for (const auto& node : buckets[index]) {
            if (node.key == key) {
                // Key already exists, update the value
                node.value = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        // Key doesn't exist, add a new node to the bucket
        buckets[index].push_back(Node(key, value));
    }

    // Retrieve the value associated with a given key
    V get(const K& key) const {
        size_t index = hash(key);
        for (const auto& node : buckets[index]) {
            if (node.key == key) {
                return node.value;
            }
        }
        // Key not found, return a default-constructed value
        return V();
    }

    // Remove a key-value pair from the HashMap
    void remove(const K& key) {
        size_t index = hash(key);
        auto& bucket = buckets[index];
        for (auto it = bucket.begin(); it != bucket.end(); ++it) {
            if ((*it).key == key) {
                bucket.erase(it);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    HashMap<std::string, int> map(10);

    map.insert("foo", 1);
    map.insert("bar", 2);
    map.insert("baz", 3);

    std::cout << "Value of 'foo': " << map.get("foo") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of 'bar': " << map.get("bar") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value of 'baz': " << map.get("baz") << std::endl;

    map.remove("bar");
    std::cout << "Value of 'bar' after removal: " << map.get("bar") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation that demonstrates the concepts of a HashMap with a bucket array and a hash function in C++. You might want to enhance it with error handling, resizing, and a more sophisticated hash function for real-world usage.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Collision Handling

Collision handling is a crucial aspect of implementing a HashMap in C++ or any other programming language. It deals with situations where two or more keys hash to the same index in the underlying array (known as a collision). There are several techniques to handle collisions in HashMaps, including:

1. **Separate Chaining**: In this approach, each bucket of the HashMap is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the collided key-value pair is inserted into the linked list at that bucket. This method ensures that multiple key-value pairs with the same hash can coexist at the same index. However, it might incur some overhead due to the memory allocated for the linked lists.

2. **Open Addressing**: This approach involves searching for an empty slot in the HashMap when a collision occurs. There are different strategies within open addressing, such as linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

    - **Linear Probing**: When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot (linearly) until it finds an empty slot.

    - **Quadratic Probing**: Similar to linear probing, but the step size increases quadratically. This helps to reduce clustering of elements.

    - **Double Hashing**: It uses a secondary hash function to determine the step size. This method often provides better performance compared to linear or quadratic probing.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This technique aims to minimize the variance in the lengths of the chains by swapping elements between buckets to balance the load.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: It involves using multiple hash functions and multiple hash tables. If a collision occurs in one table, the item is moved to another table based on a different hash function. This process continues until there are no more collisions or until a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

When implementing collision handling in C++, you would typically encapsulate the details within the HashMap implementation itself. You can choose a collision handling strategy based on factors such as expected data distribution, memory constraints, and performance requirements. Each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to consider the specific characteristics of your application when selecting one.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Inbuilt Hashmap

In C++, you typically use the `unordered_map` class from the `<unordered_map>` header for implementing a hashmap (also known as a hash table). This is part of the C++ Standard Library, and it provides a key-value mapping with average constant-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

Here's a basic example of how to use `unordered_map`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Creating an unordered_map with string keys and int values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting elements into the map
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 7;
    myMap["orange"] = 2;

    // Accessing elements
    std::cout << "Number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;

    // Iterating over the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    // Checking if a key exists
    if (myMap.find("banana") != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Banana found!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We include the necessary headers: `<iostream>` for input and output, `<unordered_map>` for `unordered_map`, and `<string>` for string manipulation.
- We create an `unordered_map` named `myMap` that maps strings to integers.
- We insert elements into the map using the bracket `[]` operator.
- We access elements using the same bracket `[]` operator.
- We iterate over the map using a range-based for loop.
- We check if a key exists using the `find()` function.

`unordered_map` uses a hash function to map keys to indices in the underlying array, which makes lookup operations very efficient on average. However, it's important to note that the order of elements in an `unordered_map` is arbitrary, unlike in `map`, where elements are ordered by their keys.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Iterators

In C++, iterators for a HashMap (also known as unordered_map) are quite similar to those of other standard containers like vectors or sets. Here's how you can use iterators with a HashMap in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::string> myMap;

    // Insert some elements into the map
    myMap[1] = "One";
    myMap[2] = "Two";
    myMap[3] = "Three";
    myMap[4] = "Four";

    // Iterate over the map using iterators
    for (auto it = myMap.begin(); it != myMap.end(); ++it) {
        std::cout << "Key: " << it->first << ", Value: " << it->second << std::endl;
    }

    // Alternatively, you can use range-based for loop
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << "Key: " << pair.first << ", Value: " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `begin()` returns an iterator to the beginning of the unordered_map.
- `end()` returns an iterator to the end of the unordered_map.
- `first` represents the key, and `second` represents the value in the key-value pair stored in the map.

Remember, unordered_map does not guarantee any particular order of elements, so the elements may not be printed in the same order as they were inserted.

If you want a constant iterator or a reverse iterator, you can use `cbegin()`, `cend()`, `crbegin()`, and `crend()` respectively. Additionally, you can use `find()` to search for a particular key in the map and get its iterator.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Rehashing

Rehashing in a hash map is the process of resizing the underlying array and redistributing the elements into the new array. This is typically done when the load factor of the hash map exceeds a certain threshold, which is usually around 0.7.

Here's a simple explanation of how rehashing works in a C++ hash map implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

using namespace std;

// Define a simple hash function
size_t hash_function(const string& key, size_t table_size) {
    size_t hash = 0;
    for (char c : key) {
        hash = (hash * 31 + c) % table_size;
    }
    return hash;
}

// Define a basic hash map class
template<typename K, typename V>
class HashMap {
private:
    vector



<pair<K, V>>> table;
    size_t size; // Number of elements in the hash map
    size_t capacity; // Current capacity of the hash map
    float load_factor_threshold; // Threshold for triggering rehashing

    void rehash() {
        // Double the capacity and find the next prime number for the new capacity
        size_t new_capacity = capacity * 2;
        while (!is_prime(new_capacity)) {
            new_capacity++;
        }

        vector<pair<K, V>> new_table(new_capacity);

        // Rehash all elements into the new table
        for (const auto& bucket : table) {
            for (const auto& pair : bucket) {
                size_t index = hash_function(pair.first, new_capacity);
                new_table[index].push_back(pair);
            }
        }

        // Replace the old table with the new one
        table = move(new_table);
        capacity = new_capacity;
    }

    bool is_prime(size_t n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        if (n <= 3) return true;
        if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
        for (size_t i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
            if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

public:
    HashMap(size_t initial_capacity = 16, float load_factor = 0.7) 
        : size(0), capacity(initial_capacity), load_factor_threshold(load_factor) {
        table.resize(capacity);
    }

    // Insert a key-value pair into the hash map
    void insert(const K& key, const V& value) {
        // Check if rehashing is needed
        if ((float)(size + 1) / capacity > load_factor_threshold) {
            rehash();
        }

        size_t index = hash_function(key, capacity);
        table[index].push_back(make_pair(key, value));
        size++;
    }

    // Search for a key in the hash map
    bool search(const K& key) {
        size_t index = hash_function(key, capacity);
        for (const auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Get the value associated with a key
    V& operator[](const K& key) {
        size_t index = hash_function(key, capacity);
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return pair.second;
            }
        }
        // If key is not found, insert a default-constructed value
        insert(key, V());
        return table[index].back().second;
    }
};

int main() {
    HashMap<string, int> my_map;
    my_map.insert("apple", 5);
    my_map.insert("banana", 3);
    my_map.insert("orange", 7);

    cout << "Value of 'apple': " << my_map["apple"] << endl;
    cout << "Value of 'banana': " << my_map["banana"] << endl;
    cout << "Value of 'orange': " << my_map["orange"] << endl;
    cout << "Value of 'grape': " << my_map["grape"] << endl; // Inserts a default value

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `HashMap` is a templated class representing the hash map.
- `table` is a vector of lists of key-value pairs. Each list is a "bucket" in the hash map.
- `rehash()` is called when the load factor exceeds a threshold. It creates a new, larger table and rehashes all elements into it.
- `insert()` inserts a new key-value pair into the hash map, triggering rehashing if necessary.
- `search()` checks if a key exists in the hash map.
- `operator[]` allows accessing values associated with keys, inserting a default value if the key doesn't exist.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Remove Duplicates

To remove duplicates from a hashmap in C++, you can iterate through the hashmap and store unique elements in a new hashmap. Here's an example implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void removeDuplicates(unordered_map<int, int>& hashMap) {
    unordered_map<int, bool> seen; // To keep track of seen elements
    vector<int> duplicates; // To store keys of duplicate elements

    // Iterate through the original hashmap
    for (auto it = hashMap.begin(); it != hashMap.end(); ++it) {
        int key = it->first;
        int value = it->second;

        // If the current element is already seen, mark it as duplicate
        if (seen.find(value) != seen.end()) {
            duplicates.push_back(key);
        } else {
            // Mark the current element as seen
            seen[value] = true;
        }
    }

    // Remove duplicate elements from the original hashmap
    for (int key : duplicates) {
        hashMap.erase(key);
    }
}

int main() {
    unordered_map<int, int> hashMap = {
        {1, 10},
        {2, 20},
        {3, 10}, // Duplicate value
        {4, 30},
        {5, 20}  // Duplicate value
    };

    cout << "Original HashMap:" << endl;
    for (const auto& pair : hashMap) {
        cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << endl;
    }

    removeDuplicates(hashMap);

    cout << "\nHashMap after removing duplicates:" << endl;
    for (const auto& pair : hashMap) {
        cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `removeDuplicates` that takes an unordered map by reference and removes duplicate values from it. It uses another hashmap (`seen`) to keep track of seen values and a vector (`duplicates`) to store keys of duplicate elements. Then, it iterates through the original hashmap, checking each element's value against the `seen` hashmap. If the value is already seen, it marks the key as a duplicate. Finally, it removes duplicate elements from the original hashmap.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): HashMap: Time Complexity & Load Factor

In C++, a HashMap, also known as an unordered_map in the Standard Template Library (STL), is an implementation of a hash table data structure. It provides fast lookup, insertion, and deletion operations on key-value pairs.

#### Time Complexity

1. **Insertion (Average Case):** O(1)
   - Average-case time complexity for insertion is O(1) assuming a good hash function and a low load factor. This is because, in the average case, the hash function distributes elements uniformly across the underlying array, leading to constant-time insertion.

2. **Insertion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - In the worst case, all the elements hash to the same bucket, leading to a linked list at that bucket's location. In this scenario, the insertion operation would have a time complexity of O(n) because it would need to traverse the entire linked list to insert the new element.

3. **Lookup/Access:** O(1)
   - Assuming a good hash function and a low load factor, the time complexity for lookup/access is O(1). This is because the hash table directly computes the index of the bucket where the element should be located.

4. **Deletion (Average Case):** O(1)
   - Similar to insertion, the average-case time complexity for deletion is O(1) assuming a good hash function and a low load factor.

5. **Deletion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - If the worst-case scenario occurs, where all elements hash to the same bucket, the deletion operation would need to traverse the linked list within that bucket to find and remove the element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).

#### Load Factor

The load factor of a hash table is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased. It is defined as:

\[ \text{Load Factor} = \frac{\text{Number of Elements}}{\text{Number of Buckets}} \]

A higher load factor means more elements are stored in the hash table, which can lead to increased collision and degrade the performance of the hash table. Typically, a load factor of around 0.7 to 0.8 is considered a good balance between memory usage and performance. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (often around 0.75), the hash table is resized to maintain a low load factor and avoid excessive collisions, which can degrade performance. Resizing typically involves creating a new, larger hash table, and rehashing all the elements into it, which is an O(n) operation.

In C++, the default load factor for `unordered_map` is typically around 0.75. You can specify a custom load factor when constructing the hash map if needed.

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    // Custom load factor example
    std::unordered_map<int, int> myMap(10); // initial size
    myMap.max_load_factor(0.5); // set custom load factor
    // Now, when the number of elements exceeds 50% of the bucket size, resizing will occur.
    
    return 0;
}
```

Understanding time complexity and load factors is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and data structures when working with hash maps in C++ or any other language.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashtables: basics

Hash tables, or hash maps, are fundamental data structures in computer science that provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. In C++, you can implement hash tables using the Standard Template Library's `std::unordered_map` or by implementing your own hashtable.

Here's a basic overview of how you can implement a hashtable in C++:

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes a key and returns an index, which is used to determine where the key-value pair will be stored in the hashtable. A good hash function aims to distribute keys evenly across the available slots in the hashtable to minimize collisions.

2. **Collision Handling**: Collisions occur when two keys hash to the same index. There are several methods for handling collisions, including chaining and open addressing.

    - **Chaining**: In chaining, each slot in the hashtable contains a linked list of key-value pairs that hashed to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply appended to the linked list.

    - **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the hashtable probes for another empty slot to place the key-value pair. Common probing techniques include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

3. **Operations**:
    - **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair into the hashtable, you first hash the key to determine the index, then insert the pair at that index according to the collision resolution strategy.

    - **Deletion**: To delete a key-value pair, you locate the pair using the key's hash, and then remove it from the hashtable.

    - **Lookup**: To find the value associated with a given key, you hash the key to find its index, then search for the key in the slot indicated by the hash.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement a hashtable using chaining:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <string>

class HashTable {
private:
    static const int size = 10; // Size of the hashtable
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<std::string, int>>> table;

    int hash(const std::string& key) {
        // Simple hash function example
        int hash = 0;
        for (char ch : key) {
            hash += ch;
        }
        return hash % size;
    }

public:
    HashTable() : table(size) {}

    void insert(const std::string& key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }

    int get(const std::string& key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        for (auto& kvp : table[index]) {
            if (kvp.first == key)
                return kvp.second;
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    void remove(const std::string& key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        table[index].remove_if([&key](const std::pair<std::string, int>& kvp) {
            return kvp.first == key;
        });
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert("apple", 10);
    ht.insert("banana", 20);
    ht.insert("orange", 30);

    std::cout << "Value for 'banana': " << ht.get("banana") << std::endl;

    ht.remove("banana");

    std::cout << "Value for 'banana' after removal: " << ht.get("banana") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of a hashtable using chaining to handle collisions. The `HashTable` class includes methods for insertion, retrieval, and deletion of key-value pairs. The `hash` method is a simple hash function that sums the ASCII values of the characters in the key and takes the modulo of the hashtable size to determine the index.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashtables: Chaining method

In the context of algorithms and data structures, hash tables (or hash maps) are a fundamental data structure used for efficient data storage and retrieval. The chaining method is one of the techniques used to handle collisions in hash tables.

Here's how the chaining method works:

1. **Hash Function**: First, you have a hash function that maps keys to indices in an array. This function takes a key as input and returns an index where the corresponding value will be stored in the array.

2. **Array of Buckets (Linked Lists)**: Instead of storing just one value per slot in the array, each slot (or bucket) in the array holds a linked list of key-value pairs. These linked lists are often called chains.

3. **Insertion**: When inserting a new key-value pair into the hash table, you first compute the hash of the key to determine the index in the array. You then insert the new key-value pair at the beginning or end of the linked list at that index.

4. **Searching**: When searching for a key, you compute its hash to find the corresponding index in the array. You then traverse the linked list at that index, looking for the key. If found, you return its corresponding value; otherwise, you return a sentinel value indicating that the key is not present.

5. **Collision Handling**: Collisions occur when two different keys hash to the same index. In the chaining method, collisions are resolved by storing multiple key-value pairs in the same array slot. This is why each slot in the array holds a linked list of key-value pairs.

6. **Load Factor and Resize**: To maintain efficiency, it's crucial to monitor the load factor of the hash table (the ratio of the number of elements to the number of slots in the array). When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the hash table is resized (usually doubled in size) to reduce collisions and maintain efficient performance.

Here's a simple example of a hash table implemented using the chaining method in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

class HashTable {
private:
    int size; // Size of the hash table
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<int, int>>> table; // Array of buckets (linked lists)

    // Hash function
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % size;
    }

public:
    HashTable(int size) : size(size), table(size) {}

    // Insertion operation
    void insert(int key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }

    // Search operation
    int search(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key) {
                return pair.second; // Return the corresponding value
            }
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht(10);
    ht.insert(5, 10);
    ht.insert(15, 20);
    ht.insert(25, 30);

    std::cout << "Value corresponding to key 15: " << ht.search(15) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value corresponding to key 7: " << ht.search(7) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation and can be expanded upon with additional features like deletion, resizing, and more sophisticated collision handling techniques.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashtables: Chaining method implementation

Implementing a hashtable using the chaining method in C++ involves creating an array of linked lists where each element in the array corresponds to a bucket. Each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index in the array. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Class representing a key-value pair
template <typename K, typename V>
class KeyValuePair {
public:
    K key;
    V value;

    KeyValuePair(const K& k, const V& v) : key(k), value(v) {}
};

// HashTable class using chaining
template <typename K, typename V>
class HashTable {
private:
    int size; // Size of the hashtable
    vector

<pair

<int, list<KeyValuePair<K, V>>>> table; // Array of linked lists

    // Hash function to determine the index
    int hashFunction(const K& key) {
        // You can use any hash function suitable for your data types
        // Here, a simple modulo operation is used
        return key % size;
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    HashTable(int tableSize) : size(tableSize) {
        table.resize(size);
    }

    // Function to insert a key-value pair into the hashtable
    void insert(const K& key, const V& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].push_back(KeyValuePair<K, V>(key, value));
    }

    // Function to search for a value given a key
    V search(const K& key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.key == key) {
                return pair.value;
            }
        }
        // If key is not found, return a default value (you can modify this behavior as per your requirement)
        return V();
    }

    // Function to remove a key-value pair
    void remove(const K& key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        table[index].remove_if([key](const KeyValuePair<K, V>& pair) { return pair.key == key; });
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable<int, string> ht(10); // Create a hashtable with size 10

    // Insert some key-value pairs
    ht.insert(5, "apple");
    ht.insert(15, "banana");
    ht.insert(25, "orange");

    // Search for a value
    cout << "Value for key 15: " << ht.search(15) << endl;

    // Remove a key-value pair
    ht.remove(15);

    // Search again after removal
    cout << "Value for key 15 after removal: " << ht.search(15) << endl; // This should print an empty string

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses `std::list` for chaining, but you could also use `std::vector` or any other data structure that supports insertion and deletion efficiently. Make sure to choose a suitable hash function for your specific keys to minimize collisions and ensure a balanced distribution of keys across buckets.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashtables: collisions

Hash tables are a powerful data structure for storing key-value pairs. One common issue with hash tables is collisions, which occur when two different keys hash to the same index in the table. Collisions can degrade the performance of hash tables if not handled properly.

There are several strategies for dealing with collisions:

1. **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket in the hash table contains a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply appended to the linked list at that index. This method allows for an unlimited number of collisions but may result in slower performance due to the overhead of managing linked lists.

2. **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the table using a predetermined probing sequence. Common probing sequences include linear probing (searching sequentially), quadratic probing (searching using quadratic increments), and double hashing (using a second hash function to determine the next position). Open addressing avoids the overhead of storing linked lists but can suffer from clustering, where groups of consecutive slots become filled, leading to slower performance.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variation of open addressing that tries to minimize the variance in probe lengths by stealing from "rich" slots (slots with shorter probe lengths) to give to "poor" slots (slots with longer probe lengths). This helps to reduce clustering and improve performance.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: In cuckoo hashing, each key is associated with two hash functions, and each key-value pair is stored in one of the two possible locations determined by the hash functions. If a collision occurs during insertion, the existing item in the chosen location is evicted and moved to its alternative location. This process continues recursively until all items are placed without collision or until a predefined limit is reached. Cuckoo hashing guarantees constant lookup time but may require significant overhead for rehashing if the table becomes full.

Each collision resolution strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of strategy depends on factors such as the expected number of elements, the distribution of hash keys, and the desired performance characteristics of the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Hashtables: load factor & dynamic resizing

Certainly! Hash tables are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to implement associative arrays, sets, or even caches. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations when the key-value pairs are stored.

Here's a brief overview of load factor and dynamic resizing in hash tables:

#### Load Factor

The load factor of a hash table is the ratio of the number of elements stored in the hash table to the size of the table. It is calculated as:

\[ \text{Load Factor} = \frac{\text{Number of Elements}}{\text{Size of Hash Table}} \]

The load factor helps to understand how "full" the hash table is. If the load factor is too high, it means that the hash table is crowded, which can lead to an increase in collisions and degradation of performance. On the other hand, if the load factor is too low, it means that there's a lot of wasted space.

#### Dynamic Resizing

To maintain a reasonable load factor and thus keep the performance of the hash table efficient, dynamic resizing is often employed. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (usually set between 0.7 and 0.9), the hash table is resized, usually doubling its size. This process involves:

1. Allocating a new, larger array.
2. Rehashing all existing elements into the new array based on the new size.
3. Freeing the memory of the old array.

Dynamic resizing ensures that the hash table remains efficient as the number of elements it contains grows, as it effectively reduces the chances of collisions.

#### Example in C++

Here's a simplified example of how dynamic resizing can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class HashTable {
private:
    std::vector<int> *table;
    int capacity;
    int size;
    float loadFactorThreshold;

    void resize(int newCapacity) {
        std::vector<int> *newTable = new std::vector<int>[newCapacity];
        for (int i = 0; i < capacity; ++i) {
            for (auto key : (*table)[i]) {
                int index = key % newCapacity;
                newTable[index].push_back(key);
            }
        }
        delete[] table;
        table = newTable;
        capacity = newCapacity;
    }

public:
    HashTable(int initialCapacity, float loadFactorThreshold) : capacity(initialCapacity), size(0), loadFactorThreshold(loadFactorThreshold) {
        table = new std::vector<int>[capacity];
    }

    void insert(int key) {
        if ((float)size / capacity > loadFactorThreshold) {
            resize(capacity * 2);
        }
        int index = key % capacity;
        table[index].push_back(key);
        ++size;
    }

    // Other methods like lookup, remove, etc.
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht(10, 0.75); // Initial capacity = 10, load factor threshold = 0.75
    ht.insert(5);
    ht.insert(15);
    ht.insert(25);
    // Other operations
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `resize()` function is called whenever the load factor exceeds the threshold. The size of the table is doubled in each resizing operation. Adjusting the load factor threshold and resizing strategy can optimize the performance based on the specific use case.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How is hash table implemented

In C++, hash tables are typically implemented using an array of linked lists or some other dynamic data structure like a balanced tree (e.g., red-black tree) for collision resolution. Here's a basic outline of how a hash table can be implemented:

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function is used to convert keys into array indices. The goal of a good hash function is to distribute the keys evenly across the array to minimize collisions.

2. **Array**: Create an array of linked lists (or some other dynamic data structure) to store the key-value pairs. Each element of the array represents a bucket, and the linked list (or other structure) stores the items that hash to the same index.

3. **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair into the hash table, apply the hash function to the key to determine the index in the array. Then, insert the key-value pair into the linked list at that index.

4. **Search**: When searching for a key, apply the hash function to the key to find the corresponding index in the array. Then, search the linked list at that index for the key.

5. **Deletion**: To delete a key from the hash table, find the index using the hash function, then search the linked list at that index for the key. If found, remove the key-value pair from the linked list.

Here's a simple example implementation in C++ using an array of vectors (a dynamic array) to handle collisions with chaining:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

class HashTable {
private:
    static const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> table[TABLE_SIZE];

    // Simple hash function to generate index
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    // Insert key-value pair into hash table
    void insert(int key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        table[index].push_back(std::make_pair(key, value));
    }

    // Search for value associated with key
    int search(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        for (const auto &pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.first == key)
                return pair.second; // Return value if key found
        }
        return -1; // Key not found
    }

    // Delete key-value pair from hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        for (auto it = table[index].begin(); it != table[index].end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                table[index].erase(it); // Remove key-value pair if key found
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;
    ht.insert(10, 100);
    ht.insert(20, 200);
    ht.insert(30, 300);

    std::cout << "Value associated with key 20: " << ht.search(20) << std::endl;

    ht.remove(20);

    std::cout << "Value associated with key 20 after removal: " << ht.search(20) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic hash table implementation using chaining for collision resolution. It uses a simple hash function (modulus operation) to map keys to indices in the array.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How to build a Hash Table

Building a hash table in C++ involves creating a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where each bucket holds a linked list of key-value pairs. Here's a basic implementation of a hash table in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>
#include <vector>

// Define the structure of a key-value pair
template<typename KeyType, typename ValueType>
struct KeyValuePair {
    KeyType key;
    ValueType value;
};

// Define the hash table class
template<typename KeyType, typename ValueType, typename Hash = std::hash<KeyType>>
class HashTable {
private:
    // Define the bucket as a list of key-value pairs
    using Bucket = std::list<KeyValuePair<KeyType, ValueType>>;
    // Define the array of buckets
    std::vector<Bucket> table;
    Hash hashFunction;

    // Helper function to find the bucket index for a given key
    size_t getBucketIndex(const KeyType& key) const {
        size_t hashValue = hashFunction(key);
        return hashValue % table.size();
    }

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the hash table with a specified number of buckets
    HashTable(size_t size = 100) : table(size) {}

    // Function to insert a key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(const KeyType& key, const ValueType& value) {
        size_t index = getBucketIndex(key);
        for (auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.key == key) {
                // If key already exists, update the value
                pair.value = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        // If key doesn't exist, add a new key-value pair to the bucket
        table[index].push_back({key, value});
    }

    // Function to retrieve the value associated with a key
    // Returns true if key exists, false otherwise
    bool find(const KeyType& key, ValueType& value) const {
        size_t index = getBucketIndex(key);
        for (const auto& pair : table[index]) {
            if (pair.key == key) {
                value = pair.value;
                return true; // Key found
            }
        }
        return false; // Key not found
    }

    // Function to remove a key-value pair from the hash table
    void remove(const KeyType& key) {
        size_t index = getBucketIndex(key);
        auto& bucket = table[index];
        for (auto it = bucket.begin(); it != bucket.end(); ++it) {
            if (it->key == key) {
                bucket.erase(it);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable<std::string, int> ht;

    // Insert some key-value pairs
    ht.insert("apple", 10);
    ht.insert("banana", 20);
    ht.insert("orange", 30);

    // Retrieve and print the values
    int value;
    if (ht.find("banana", value)) {
        std::cout << "Value for banana: " << value << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Key 'banana' not found" << std::endl;
    }

    // Remove a key-value pair
    ht.remove("banana");

    // Check if the removed key still exists
    if (ht.find("banana", value)) {
        std::cout << "Value for banana: " << value << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Key 'banana' not found" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `KeyValuePair` struct to hold the key-value pairs.
- The hash table class `HashTable` uses a vector of lists (`std::vector<std::list<KeyValuePair<KeyType, ValueType>>>`) as the underlying data structure. Each element of the vector is a bucket, and each bucket is a linked list of key-value pairs.
- The `getBucketIndex` function calculates the index of the bucket for a given key using the hash function.
- The `insert` function inserts a key-value pair into the hash table.
- The `find` function searches for a key and retrieves its corresponding value.
- The `remove` function removes a key-value pair from the hash table.

This is a basic implementation; you can extend it further by adding functionalities like handling collisions (e.g., using chaining or open addressing), resizing the hash table when it becomes too full, and implementing more efficient hash functions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Importance of Hash Codes. Implementing GetHashCode

Hash codes are crucial in algorithms and data structures for various reasons:

1. **Hash Tables**: In data structures like hash tables, hash codes are used to determine the index of an element in an array (hash table) where the element will be stored or retrieved. This enables fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements.

2. **Hash Sets and Hash Maps**: Similarly, in hash sets and hash maps, hash codes are used to efficiently store and retrieve elements or key-value pairs.

3. **Performance**: Hash codes are used to distribute data uniformly across a range of indices, which helps in achieving better performance by minimizing collisions (when two distinct inputs have the same hash code).

4. **Searching and Indexing**: Hash codes are used in various searching and indexing algorithms to quickly locate elements or records.

Implementing `GetHashCode` in C++ involves creating a hash function that maps objects to integers. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class MyClass {
private:
    std::string data;

public:
    MyClass(const std::string& str) : data(str) {}

    // Implementing GetHashCode function
    size_t GetHashCode() const {
        // A simple hash function using polynomial rolling hash
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        size_t hash_value = 0;
        size_t p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : data) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj("hello");
    std::cout << "Hash code of 'hello': " << obj.GetHashCode() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `GetHashCode` function generates a hash code for the `MyClass` object based on the characters of the `data` member using a polynomial rolling hash technique. However, the choice of hash function depends on the specific requirements of your application, and you may need to use different hash functions for different types of data.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt HashMap

In C++, the standard library provides an implementation of a hash table through the `std::unordered_map` class, which is part of the `<unordered_map>` header. This data structure is sometimes referred to as a hash map or dictionary.

Here's a basic example of how to use `std::unordered_map`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Creating an unordered_map with string keys and integer values
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> myMap;

    // Inserting values into the map
    myMap["apple"] = 5;
    myMap["banana"] = 3;
    myMap["orange"] = 7;

    // Accessing values
    std::cout << "Number of apples: " << myMap["apple"] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of bananas: " << myMap["banana"] << std::endl;

    // Modifying values
    myMap["banana"] = 10;

    // Checking if a key exists
    if (myMap.find("orange") != myMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Found orange!" << std::endl;
    }

    // Iterating over the map
    for (const auto& pair : myMap) {
        std::cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::unordered_map<std::string, int>` is declared to create a map where keys are strings and values are integers. You can use any type for keys and values, as long as they support hashing and equality comparison.

The `[]` operator is used both for inserting new key-value pairs and accessing existing values. If the key is not present in the map, it is added with the provided value.

The `find()` method is used to check if a key exists in the map. It returns an iterator pointing to the element if found, otherwise, it returns `myMap.end()`.

This is a basic usage of `std::unordered_map`. Depending on your requirements, you can explore more advanced functionalities provided by the standard library or consider using other libraries or implementations for hash maps.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Linear Probing

Linear probing is a technique used in hash tables to handle collisions, where multiple keys hash to the same index. In linear probing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm looks for the next available slot in the hash table, starting from the collision point, until an empty slot is found.

Here's how linear probing works in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Hash Table using Linear Probing
class HashTable {
private:
    static const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;
    vector<pair<int, string>> table;

    // Hash function
    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    HashTable() : table(TABLE_SIZE) {}

    // Insert key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(int key, const string& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);

        // Linear probing to find an empty slot
        while (table[index].first != 0) {
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE;
        }

        table[index] = make_pair(key, value);
    }

    // Search for a key in the hash table
    string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);

        // Linear probing to find the key
        while (table[index].first != 0 && table[index].first != key) {
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE;
        }

        // If key found, return its corresponding value
        if (table[index].first == key) {
            return table[index].second;
        }

        // Key not found
        return "Key not found";
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable hashTable;

    // Insert key-value pairs
    hashTable.insert(1, "Alice");
    hashTable.insert(2, "Bob");
    hashTable.insert(11, "Charlie"); // Hashes to the same index as key 1

    // Search for keys
    cout << "Value for key 1: " << hashTable.search(1) << endl;
    cout << "Value for key 2: " << hashTable.search(2) << endl;
    cout << "Value for key 11: " << hashTable.search(11) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `HashTable` class that uses linear probing to handle collisions. The `insert` function inserts a key-value pair into the hash table, and the `search` function searches for a key and returns its corresponding value. Linear probing is used to handle collisions by finding the next available slot in the hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Linkedin Hash Tables / Dictionaries question: Minimum Window Substring

The Minimum Window Substring problem is a classic problem in computer science and is often used to test understanding of string manipulation and algorithms like hash tables. Here's how you can approach it in C++ using hash tables:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

string minWindowSubstring(string s, string t) {
    unordered_map<char, int> targetFreq, windowFreq;
    
    // Count the frequency of characters in string t
    for (char c : t)
        targetFreq[c]++;
    
    int required = targetFreq.size(); // Number of unique characters in t
    int formed = 0; // Number of unique characters formed in the current window
    int left = 0, right = 0; // Window pointers
    int minLen = INT_MAX, minLeft = -1, minRight = -1; // Variables to track the minimum window
    
    while (right < s.length()) {
        char currentChar = s[right];
        
        // Update the frequency of the current character in the window
        windowFreq[currentChar]++;
        
        // If the frequency of the current character matches the required frequency, increment formed
        if (targetFreq.count(currentChar) && windowFreq[currentChar] == targetFreq[currentChar])
            formed++;
        
        // Try to minimize the window by moving the left pointer
        while (left <= right && formed == required) {
            // Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller
            if (right - left + 1 < minLen) {
                minLen = right - left + 1;
                minLeft = left;
                minRight = right;
            }
            
            char leftChar = s[left];
            // Reduce the frequency of the character at the left pointer
            windowFreq[leftChar]--;
            
            // If the frequency of the character at the left pointer falls below the required frequency, decrement formed
            if (targetFreq.count(leftChar) && windowFreq[leftChar] < targetFreq[leftChar])
                formed--;
            
            // Move the left pointer to try to find a smaller window
            left++;
        }
        
        // Move the right pointer to expand the window
        right++;
    }
    
    // Return the minimum window substring
    return minLeft == -1 ? "" : s.substr(minLeft, minLen);
}

int main() {
    string s = "ADOBECODEBANC";
    string t = "ABC";
    
    cout << "Minimum window substring: " << minWindowSubstring(s, t) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code maintains two pointers, `left` and `right`, which define the current window. It iterates through the string `s` using the `right` pointer to expand the window. Once all the characters in `t` are found in the current window, it tries to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer. Finally, it returns the minimum window substring found.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max Heap

A Max Heap is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for implementing priority queues and for efficient sorting algorithms like heapsort. It's a binary tree where the key at each node is at least as large as the keys at its children. The maximum element is always at the root.

In C++, you can implement a Max Heap using arrays efficiently. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class MaxHeap {
private:
    vector<int> heap;

    void heapifyUp(int index) {
        int parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        while (index > 0 && heap[index] > heap[parent]) {
            swap(heap[index], heap[parent]);
            index = parent;
            parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

    void heapifyDown(int index) {
        int leftChild, rightChild, largestChild;
        while (true) {
            leftChild = 2 * index + 1;
            rightChild = 2 * index + 2;
            largestChild = index;

            if (leftChild < heap.size() && heap[leftChild] > heap[largestChild])
                largestChild = leftChild;
            if (rightChild < heap.size() && heap[rightChild] > heap[largestChild])
                largestChild = rightChild;

            if (largestChild == index)
                break;

            swap(heap[index], heap[largestChild]);
            index = largestChild;
        }
    }

public:
    void insert(int value) {
        heap.push_back(value);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    int extractMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            cerr << "Heap is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // or throw an exception
        }

        int maxElement = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap.back();
        heap.pop_back();
        heapifyDown(0);
        return maxElement;
    }

    int getMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            cerr << "Heap is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // or throw an exception
        }
        return heap[0];
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return heap.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    MaxHeap maxHeap;
    maxHeap.insert(5);
    maxHeap.insert(10);
    maxHeap.insert(3);
    maxHeap.insert(8);

    cout << "Max element: " << maxHeap.extractMax() << endl; // Output: 10
    cout << "Max element: " << maxHeap.extractMax() << endl; // Output: 8
    cout << "Max element: " << maxHeap.extractMax() << endl; // Output: 5

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation provides the basic functionalities of a Max Heap such as insertion, extraction of the maximum element, and checking if the heap is empty. The `heapifyUp` and `heapifyDown` functions ensure that the heap property is maintained after insertions and extractions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Practical (real-world) applications of hashing

Hashing, a fundamental concept in computer science, finds practical applications across various domains. In C++, here are some real-world applications of hashing:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Hashing is widely used in data retrieval systems such as databases and search engines. Hash functions are employed to index data efficiently. For instance, in a database management system, hashing can be used to quickly locate records based on keys, significantly reducing search time.

2. **Cryptography**: Hash functions play a crucial role in cryptographic applications. They are used in digital signatures, password hashing, and message authentication codes (MACs). For example, in password hashing, a hash function is applied to a password to generate a fixed-size hash value, which is stored securely instead of the plaintext password.

3. **Caching**: Hashing is used in caching mechanisms to quickly access cached data. In web servers and browsers, caching frequently accessed resources such as web pages, images, and scripts can significantly improve performance. Hashing allows efficient storage and retrieval of cached items.

4. **Distributed Systems**: Hashing is essential in distributed systems for load balancing and data partitioning. Consistent hashing, in particular, is widely used to distribute data across multiple servers while ensuring minimal disruption when servers are added or removed from the system.

5. **String Matching**: Hashing is employed in string matching algorithms such as Rabin-Karp. By hashing substrings of a text and comparing them to the hash of the pattern, string matching can be performed efficiently, especially in cases where multiple pattern searches are required.

6. **Compiler Design**: Hashing is used in symbol tables of compilers for fast symbol lookup. When compiling a program, a symbol table is maintained to store information about variables, functions, and other symbols. Hashing helps in quickly locating symbols during compilation.

7. **File Systems**: Hashing is utilized in file systems for efficient file storage and retrieval. File systems often use hash functions to generate unique identifiers (such as inode numbers in Unix-based systems) for files and directories, enabling quick access and manipulation.

8. **Networking**: Hashing is employed in network protocols and routing algorithms. For example, in peer-to-peer networks, Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) use hashing to map keys to nodes in the network efficiently, facilitating decentralized data storage and retrieval.

In each of these applications, the choice of hash function and hashing technique depends on factors such as performance requirements, collision handling strategies, and security considerations. C++ provides a variety of hash functions and data structures (like std::unordered_map and std::unordered_set) that can be used effectively in implementing these applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Practical Use of Hashing

Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used in various algorithms and data structures for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. In C++, hashing can be practically applied in several scenarios, some of which include:

1. **Hash Tables**: Hash tables are one of the most common data structures that utilize hashing. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations with an average time complexity of O(1) for these operations. In C++, you can implement a hash table using the `unordered_map` or `unordered_set` containers from the C++ Standard Library. These containers use hashing internally to achieve constant-time average performance.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> ages;

    // Inserting elements into the hash table
    ages["Alice"] = 30;
    ages["Bob"] = 25;
    ages["Charlie"] = 35;

    // Retrieving elements from the hash table
    std::cout << "Alice's age: " << ages["Alice"] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. **Hash-based Set Operations**: Hashing can be used to efficiently perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference. By using hash sets, you can achieve better performance compared to other set representations like sorted arrays or binary search trees.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int main() {
    std::unordered_set<int> set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::unordered_set<int> set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

    // Intersection of two sets
    std::unordered_set<int> intersection;
    for (int x : set1) {
        if (set2.find(x) != set2.end()) {
            intersection.insert(x);
        }
    }

    // Output intersection
    for (int x : intersection) {
        std::cout << x << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

1. **String Hashing**: Hashing is extensively used in string processing tasks like searching, matching, and indexing. Algorithms like Rabin-Karp and rolling hash use hashing to efficiently search for substrings within a larger text.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

unsigned long long hash(const std::string& s) {
    unsigned long long h = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        h = h * 31 + c; // A commonly used hash function
    }
    return h;
}

int main() {
    std::string pattern = "abc";
    std::string text = "abcdeabc";

    unsigned long long patternHash = hash(pattern);
    unsigned long long curHash = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < pattern.size(); ++i) {
        curHash = curHash * 31 + text[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= text.size() - pattern.size(); ++i) {
        if (curHash == patternHash) {
            if (text.substr(i, pattern.size()) == pattern) {
                std::cout << "Pattern found at index " << i << std::endl;
            }
        }
        if (i < text.size() - pattern.size()) {
            curHash = curHash * 31 - text[i] * 31 * pattern.size() + text[i + pattern.size()];
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

These are just a few examples of how hashing can be practically used in C++. Depending on the problem at hand, there are numerous other applications and variations of hashing techniques that can be employed for efficient algorithmic solutions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Pros and Cons of Hashing Resolution Techniques

In hashing, resolution techniques are methods used to handle collisions, which occur when two different keys hash to the same index in a hash table. Here are the pros and cons of some common hashing resolution techniques in C++:

1. **Separate Chaining**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Simple to implement: Each slot in the hash table can be a linked list, making it easy to manage collisions.
     - Efficient for handling frequent collisions: Items with the same hash value are stored in a linked list, ensuring fast insertion and retrieval.
   - **Cons**:
     - Extra memory overhead: Requires additional memory for linked lists.
     - Cache inefficiency: Memory allocations for linked lists may not be contiguous, leading to poor cache performance.

2. **Open Addressing**:
   - **Linear Probing**:
     - **Pros**:
       - Simple and easy to implement.
       - Good cache performance: Utilizes cache effectively due to linear scanning.
     - **Cons**:
       - Clustering: Leads to clustering of elements in the table, which can degrade performance.
       - Poor worst-case performance: Performance can degrade significantly if the table becomes nearly full.
   - **Quadratic Probing**:
     - **Pros**:
       - Helps alleviate clustering: Scattering elements across the table can improve performance.
       - Better than linear probing for certain distributions of keys.
     - **Cons**:
       - Still prone to clustering: Clustering may still occur, though less frequently than in linear probing.
       - More complex than linear probing.
   - **Double Hashing**:
     - **Pros**:
       - Avoids primary clustering: By using a second hash function, double hashing reduces primary clustering.
       - Generally faster than linear and quadratic probing.
     - **Cons**:
       - More complex implementation than linear probing.
       - Sensitive to the choice of the second hash function.

3. **Cuckoo Hashing**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Guarantees constant lookup time.
     - Resistant to primary clustering.
   - **Cons**:
     - Complexity: Implementation can be complex.
     - Space overhead: Requires multiple hash tables, increasing memory usage.
     - Limited to two hash functions.

Each resolution technique has its trade-offs in terms of simplicity, performance, memory usage, and ease of implementation. The choice of technique depends on factors such as the expected data distribution, memory constraints, and performance requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Quadratic Probing

Quadratic probing is a technique used in hash tables to resolve collisions. When a hash function maps two keys to the same index, quadratic probing provides an alternative index for the second key by adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial to the initial hash value until an empty slot is found.

Here's a basic implementation of quadratic probing in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Hash table size
const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;

class HashTable {
private:
    // Structure to hold key-value pairs
    struct HashNode {
        int key;
        int value;
        bool deleted; // Flag to mark a node as deleted
        HashNode() : key(-1), value(-1), deleted(false) {}
    };

    vector



```cpp


```cpp
    <HashNode> table;

public:
    HashTable() : table(TABLE_SIZE) {}

    // Hash function
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

    // Insert key-value pair into the hash table
    void insert(int key, int value) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int i = 1;
        while (table[index].key != -1 && table[index].key != key && !table[index].deleted) {
            index = (index + i * i) % TABLE_SIZE; // Quadratic probing
            i++;
        }
        table[index].key = key;
        table[index].value = value;
        table[index].deleted = false;
    }

    // Search for a key in the hash table
    int search(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int i = 1;
        while (table[index].key != -1 && table[index].key != key) {
            index = (index + i * i) % TABLE_SIZE; // Quadratic probing
            i++;
        }
        if (table[index].key == key && !table[index].deleted) {
            return table[index].value;
        } else {
            return -1; // Key not found
        }
    }

    // Delete a key from the hash table
    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hash(key);
        int i = 1;
        while (table[index].key != -1 && table[index].key != key) {
            index = (index + i * i) % TABLE_SIZE; // Quadratic probing
            i++;
        }
        if (table[index].key == key) {
            table[index].key = -1;
            table[index].value = -1;
            table[index].deleted = true;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;

    // Insert some key-value pairs
    ht.insert(1, 10);
    ht.insert(2, 20);
    ht.insert(3, 30);

    // Search for a key
    int value = ht.search(2);
    if (value != -1) {
        cout << "Value found: " << value << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Key not found" << endl;
    }

    // Remove a key
    ht.remove(2);

    // Search again after removal
    value = ht.search(2);
    if (value != -1) {
        cout << "Value found: " << value << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Key not found" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a basic implementation of a hash table using quadratic probing for collision resolution.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Rolling Hash

A rolling hash is a hashing technique used in computer science, particularly in string processing algorithms. It's often utilized in algorithms that need to efficiently compare or analyze substrings within a larger string. The primary advantage of a rolling hash is that it allows you to compute the hash value of a substring quickly by reusing the hash value of the previous substring.

In the context of C++, you can implement a rolling hash using various hashing algorithms such as polynomial hashing or Rabin-Karp hashing. Here's a basic implementation of a rolling hash using polynomial hashing:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

const int p = 31; // prime number for polynomial hashing
const int m = 1e9 + 9; // modulo value for avoiding overflow

long long compute_hash(const string& s) {
    long long hash_value = 0;
    long long p_pow = 1;
    for (char c : s) {
        hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
        p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
    }
    return hash_value;
}

long long rolling_hash(const string& s, int len) {
    long long hash_value = compute_hash(s.substr(0, len));
    long long p_pow = 1;
    for (int i = len; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        hash_value = (hash_value - (s[i - len] - 'a' + 1) + m) % m;
        hash_value = (hash_value * p + (s[i] - 'a' + 1)) % m;
    }
    return hash_value;
}

int main() {
    string text = "hello world";
    int window_size = 5;
    long long hash_value = rolling_hash(text, window_size);
    cout << "Hash value of first window: " << hash_value << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `compute_hash` function calculates the hash value of a string using polynomial hashing.
- `rolling_hash` function calculates the hash value of a sliding window of length `len` in the string `s`.
- The main function demonstrates how to use `rolling_hash` to compute the hash value of a substring/window in a text.

This is a basic implementation, and depending on your requirements, you might need to handle collisions, optimize the hash function for better distribution, or consider different modulo values to minimize collisions and overflows. Additionally, in real-world applications, you may want to implement error checking and validation to ensure robustness.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Runtime characteristics of Hash Tables

Hash tables are a fundamental data structure used in computer science for fast data retrieval. They offer efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, often with an average time complexity of O(1). However, understanding their runtime characteristics requires a deeper dive:

1. **Insertion (Average Case)**:
   - Hash tables provide constant-time average-case insertion. The element is hashed to determine its index in the table, and then inserted. In ideal scenarios, each insertion takes O(1) time.

2. **Insertion (Worst Case)**:
   - In the worst-case scenario, all elements hash to the same index, leading to a long linked list at that index. This can occur due to poor hash functions or hash function collisions. In such cases, insertion may degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.

3. **Deletion (Average Case)**:
   - Similar to insertion, deletion in hash tables has an average time complexity of O(1). The element is hashed to locate its position and then deleted.

4. **Deletion (Worst Case)**:
   - As with insertion, if all elements hash to the same index, deletion could degrade to O(n) if the linked list at that index becomes long.

5. **Search/Lookup (Average Case)**:
   - Hash tables offer constant-time average-case search/lookup. The element's hash is computed, and the corresponding bucket is checked for the presence of the element. On average, this operation takes O(1) time.

6. **Search/Lookup (Worst Case)**:
   - In the worst-case scenario, when all elements hash to the same index, the search operation can degrade to O(n) if the linked list at that index becomes long.

7. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity of a hash table is O(n+m), where n is the number of elements stored in the hash table, and m is the number of buckets or slots. However, this can vary depending on the implementation, especially if the hash table dynamically resizes.

8. **Collision Handling**:
   - Collisions occur when two distinct elements hash to the same index. Various collision resolution techniques such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store collided elements) or open addressing (probing for alternative slots) are used to handle collisions. The choice of collision resolution method impacts the runtime characteristics.

9. **Hash Function Quality**:
   - The performance of hash tables heavily depends on the quality of the hash function used. A good hash function evenly distributes elements across the available slots, reducing the likelihood of collisions and ensuring better runtime characteristics.

In summary, while hash tables offer excellent average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations with O(1) complexity, their worst-case performance can degrade significantly, especially when dealing with poor hash functions or high collision rates. Understanding the characteristics of both the data being stored and the hash function being used is crucial for designing efficient hash table implementations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symbol Tables

In computer science, a symbol table is a data structure used to store and manage information about symbols, such as identifiers or keys, and their associated values. These symbols could be variables, functions, objects, or any other entity that needs to be uniquely identified within a program.

In C++, symbol tables are often implemented using various data structures, with hash tables and balanced search trees being two common choices. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Hash Tables**: Hash tables provide fast lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. In a hash table, each symbol is hashed to a unique index in an array. The hash function converts the symbol into an array index. Collisions, where two symbols hash to the same index, are typically handled using techniques like chaining (where each array element holds a linked list of key-value pairs) or open addressing (where the table is probed for an empty slot when a collision occurs). In C++, you can use the `std::unordered_map` from the `<unordered_map>` header to implement a hash table.

2. **Balanced Search Trees (e.g., Red-Black Trees)**: Balanced search trees maintain their keys in sorted order, which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Red-Black Trees are a popular choice for implementing symbol tables because they guarantee logarithmic time complexity for these operations. In C++, you can use the `std::map` or `std::set` containers from the `<map>` and `<set>` headers, respectively, to implement balanced search trees.

When choosing between hash tables and balanced search trees for a symbol table implementation in C++, consider factors such as the expected number of symbols, the frequency of operations (lookup, insertion, deletion), memory usage, and the performance characteristics of the underlying data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symbol Tables and Hashing

Symbol tables and hashing are fundamental concepts in computer science and are often used in the implementation of algorithms and data structures. In C++, symbol tables are commonly implemented using hash tables due to their efficiency in providing constant-time average-case performance for basic operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

Here's a brief overview of symbol tables and hashing in C++:

1. **Symbol Tables**:
   - A symbol table is a data structure used to associate keys with values.
   - It allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs.
   - In C++, symbol tables can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, or hash tables.
   - Hash tables are often preferred for their constant-time average-case performance.

2. **Hashing**:
   - Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically integers, called hash codes.
   - Hash functions are used to compute these hash codes.
   - A good hash function aims to distribute keys uniformly across a range of hash codes to minimize collisions (i.e., when two different keys hash to the same value).
   - In C++, the `std::hash` function is commonly used to compute hash codes for built-in types, and custom hash functions can be defined for user-defined types.
   - Collision resolution techniques such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to handle multiple keys hashing to the same value) or open addressing (probing to find alternative slots) are used to handle collisions in hash tables.

3. **C++ Implementation**:
   - C++ provides the `unordered_map` class in the `<unordered_map>` header for implementing hash tables.
   - It provides an associative container that stores key-value pairs using a hash table-based data structure.
   - The `unordered_map` class provides operations like `insert`, `erase`, and `find` for efficient manipulation of key-value pairs.
   - Custom hash functions can be defined using function objects or lambdas and passed to the `unordered_map` constructor or specialized as template arguments.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of `unordered_map` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> ages;

    // Inserting key-value pairs
    ages["Alice"] = 30;
    ages["Bob"] = 25;
    ages["Charlie"] = 35;

    // Accessing values
    std::cout << "Alice's age: " << ages["Alice"] << std::endl;

    // Checking if a key exists
    if (ages.find("Dave") != ages.end()) {
        std::cout << "Dave's age: " << ages["Dave"] << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Dave not found." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This example creates an `unordered_map` called `ages` that maps `std::string` keys (names) to `int` values (ages). It demonstrates insertion, access, and checking for the existence of keys in the map.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of Hash Table

In C++, hash tables are typically implemented using the `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` containers from the Standard Template Library (STL), which are based on hashing techniques. There are various types of hash tables based on the different collision resolution strategies they employ. Here are some common types:

1. **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs (i.e., two different keys hash to the same bucket), the colliding elements are simply appended to the linked list of that bucket. This method is straightforward and easy to implement.

2. **Open Addressing**:
   - **Linear Probing**: When a collision occurs, linear probing checks the next slot sequentially until it finds an empty slot. The primary issue with linear probing is the clustering problem, where consecutive slots get filled, leading to performance degradation.
   - **Quadratic Probing**: This is similar to linear probing, but the interval between probes increases quadratically. It helps to reduce clustering to some extent.
   - **Double Hashing**: In this technique, a second hash function is used to determine the interval between probes. This reduces clustering and provides better performance compared to linear or quadratic probing.

3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: This is a variation of open addressing where the aim is to minimize the variance in probe lengths. When inserting a new element, if its probe length (distance from the initial hashed bucket) is shorter than that of the existing element in the bucket, it swaps places with the existing element, thereby trying to minimize the maximum probe length.

4. **Cuckoo Hashing**: In cuckoo hashing, each key can hash to multiple buckets (usually two). If a key hashes to a bucket that is already occupied, it displaces the existing key to its alternative location. This displacement can trigger a chain reaction, hence the name "cuckoo," reminiscent of the behavior of cuckoo birds.

Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on factors such as the expected usage pattern, the distribution of keys, and performance requirements. C++'s STL provides `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` implementations which typically use chaining as their collision resolution strategy, although the exact implementation details are compiler-dependent. If you need a specific collision resolution strategy, you might need to implement your own hash table.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Using Linear Probing to resolve Collision

Linear probing is a simple technique used in hash tables to resolve collisions. When a collision occurs (i.e., when two keys hash to the same index), linear probing tries to find the next available slot by linearly traversing the table until an empty slot is found.

Here's a basic implementation of a hash table using linear probing in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

const int TABLE_SIZE = 10;

class HashTable {
private:
    struct HashNode {
        int key;
        string value;
        bool isEmpty;

        HashNode() : key(-1), value(""), isEmpty(true) {}
    };

    HashNode* table[TABLE_SIZE];

    int hashFunction(int key) {
        return key % TABLE_SIZE;
    }

public:
    HashTable() {
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; ++i) {
            table[i] = nullptr;
        }
    }

    void insert(int key, const string& value) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        while (table[index] != nullptr && !table[index]->isEmpty) {
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Linear probing
        }

        if (table[index] == nullptr) {
            table[index] = new HashNode();
        }

        table[index]->key = key;
        table[index]->value = value;
        table[index]->isEmpty = false;
    }

    string search(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        while (table[index] != nullptr) {
            if (!table[index]->isEmpty && table[index]->key == key) {
                return table[index]->value;
            }
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Linear probing
        }
        return "Not found";
    }

    void remove(int key) {
        int index = hashFunction(key);
        while (table[index] != nullptr) {
            if (!table[index]->isEmpty && table[index]->key == key) {
                table[index]->isEmpty = true;
                table[index]->key = -1;
                table[index]->value = "";
                return;
            }
            index = (index + 1) % TABLE_SIZE; // Linear probing
        }
    }

    ~HashTable() {
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; ++i) {
            delete table[i];
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    HashTable ht;

    ht.insert(1, "John");
    ht.insert(11, "Doe");
    ht.insert(21, "Smith");

    cout << "Search for key 1: " << ht.search(1) << endl;
    cout << "Search for key 11: " << ht.search(11) << endl;
    cout << "Search for key 21: " << ht.search(21) << endl;
    cout << "Search for key 2: " << ht.search(2) << endl;

    ht.remove(1);

    cout << "After removing key 1, search for key 1: " << ht.search(1) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to implement a basic hash table using linear probing to resolve collisions. The `insert`, `search`, and `remove` operations are implemented with linear probing to handle collisions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are hash tables ?

Hash tables are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming for efficient data storage and retrieval. They are also known as hash maps, hash sets, or dictionaries in different programming languages.

A hash table is essentially an associative array that stores key-value pairs. The key is used to compute a hash code, which is a numerical value generated by a hash function. This hash code is then used as an index to store the associated value in an array-like structure called a hash table.

Here's how they work:

1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes an input (usually the key) and produces a fixed-size numeric value, known as the hash code. The goal of a good hash function is to evenly distribute keys across the hash table to minimize collisions (more on this later).

2. **Array Structure**: The hash table internally consists of an array of slots or buckets, each capable of holding one key-value pair.

3. **Hashing**: When you want to insert a key-value pair into the hash table, you first compute the hash code for the key using the hash function. This hash code determines the index in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

4. **Collision Handling**: Since multiple keys can sometimes produce the same hash code (collision), hash tables typically employ techniques to handle collisions. Common collision resolution methods include chaining and open addressing.

    - **Chaining**: In chaining, each slot of the hash table contains a linked list of key-value pairs. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is simply added to the linked list at that index.

    - **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the hash table probes for another empty slot in the array until it finds one. This can involve techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing.

5. **Lookup and Retrieval**: To retrieve a value associated with a key, you compute the hash code for the key, locate the corresponding slot in the array, and then search within that slot (using the appropriate collision resolution method) for the desired key-value pair.

Hash tables offer efficient average-case time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup, often O(1) assuming a good hash function and minimal collisions. However, in the worst-case scenario (e.g., if all keys produce the same hash code), the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table. Therefore, choosing a suitable hash function and collision resolution strategy is crucial for the performance of hash tables.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The key advantage of hash tables is their ability to provide constant-time average-case complexity for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup, making them efficient for handling large datasets.

In a hash table, the keys are hashed, which means they are transformed into a numeric value, typically within a specific range. This hashed value is used as an index or address in an array where the corresponding value is stored. Collisions may occur when two different keys hash to the same index, and hash tables typically employ collision resolution techniques to handle this, such as chaining (where each bucket stores a linked list of key-value pairs) or open addressing (where alternative locations are searched within the table).

Hash tables are widely used in various applications such as database indexing, caching, and implementing associative arrays in programming languages. In C++, hash tables are commonly implemented using the `std::unordered_map` container in the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides an interface for key-value storage with constant-time average-case complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is Hashing

Hashing is a technique used in computer science to efficiently retrieve, store, and manage data in large datasets. It involves mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically integers, known as hash codes or hash values. These hash codes are generated by a hash function, which takes the input data and produces a hash code based on its properties.

In the context of algorithms and data structures, hashing is often used for:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Hashing allows for fast retrieval of data by using the hash code as an index in an array or a similar data structure called a hash table. This enables constant-time (O(1)) average-case lookup, making it very efficient for search operations.

2. **Data Storage**: Hashing can be used to store data in a structured manner. Each element is hashed, and the resulting hash code is used to determine where the data should be stored in memory. This makes it suitable for implementing dictionaries, sets, caches, and other data structures.

3. **Data Integrity and Security**: Hashing is also used for ensuring data integrity and security. Hash functions produce unique hash codes for different inputs, making it possible to detect changes or corruption in data. Hashing is widely used in cryptographic applications such as digital signatures, password hashing, and data verification.

Common hash functions include cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), as well as simpler functions like the modulo operation for integer keys.

In C++, hashing is often implemented using the Standard Template Library's (STL) `std::hash` function or custom hash functions tailored to specific data types or applications. Additionally, C++ provides the `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set` containers, which are implementations of hash tables, offering efficient data storage and retrieval based on hashing.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is Hashing? Why we need it?

Hashing is a technique used in computer science to efficiently store and retrieve data in a data structure called a hash table. It involves mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically integers, which are used to index into an array. The mapping function used to generate these indices is called a hash function.

Here's why we need hashing:

1. **Fast Data Retrieval**: Hashing provides constant-time (O(1)) average-case complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations. This is because accessing an element in an array by its index is a constant-time operation.

2. **Efficient Storage**: Hashing allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs, making it suitable for implementing associative arrays or dictionaries. Instead of storing the actual data elements in the array, we store references or pointers to them, reducing memory usage.

3. **Search Performance**: Hash tables offer efficient search performance. By quickly mapping keys to indices in an array, hashing enables fast searches for specific elements.

4. **Uniqueness**: Hashing can be used to enforce uniqueness in data structures. By generating a unique hash value for each distinct element, duplicate elements can be easily identified and handled.

5. **Distributed Computing**: In distributed computing environments, hashing is often used for load balancing and partitioning data across multiple nodes or servers. Each node can be responsible for a portion of the data based on its hash value, facilitating parallel processing and efficient resource utilization.

6. **Cryptographic Applications**: Hash functions are fundamental in cryptography for generating message digests (hash values) that uniquely represent data. These digests are used for data integrity verification, digital signatures, and password hashing.

Overall, hashing is a versatile and efficient technique that finds applications in various areas of computer science, including databases, networking, cryptography, and algorithm design.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What so great about Hash Tables?

Hash tables are incredibly useful data structures in computer science for several reasons:

1. **Fast Lookup**: Hash tables provide constant-time average case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, making them extremely efficient for storing and retrieving data. This constant-time behavior is achieved by using a hash function to map keys to indexes in an array.

2. **Flexibility**: Hash tables can store key-value pairs, allowing for flexible data organization. This makes them suitable for a wide range of applications where data needs to be stored and retrieved quickly based on a unique identifier (the key).

3. **Dynamic Resizing**: Good hash table implementations dynamically resize themselves as the number of elements stored in them changes. This ensures that the load factor (ratio of stored elements to total capacity) remains within acceptable bounds, preventing performance degradation due to clustering or excessive collisions.

4. **Adaptability**: Hash tables can be tailored to specific use cases by choosing appropriate hash functions and collision resolution strategies. This adaptability allows developers to optimize hash table performance for their particular application requirements.

5. **Cache Efficiency**: Hash tables typically use arrays as their underlying data structure, which results in good cache locality. This means that accessing elements in a hash table can be very efficient due to the way modern computer architectures handle memory caching.

6. **Widely Used**: Hash tables are a fundamental building block of many programming languages' standard libraries, and they are used extensively in databases, caching systems, compilers, and many other applications.

Overall, the combination of fast lookup, flexibility, dynamic resizing, adaptability, cache efficiency, and widespread adoption makes hash tables an indispensable tool for software developers when designing efficient algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Linkedin Hash Tables / Dictionaries question: Minimum Window Substring

The Minimum Window Substring problem is a classic problem in computer science and is often used to test understanding of string manipulation and algorithms like hash tables. Here's how you can approach it in C++ using hash tables:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

string minWindowSubstring(string s, string t) {
    unordered_map<char, int> targetFreq, windowFreq;
    
    // Count the frequency of characters in string t
    for (char c : t)
        targetFreq[c]++;
    
    int required = targetFreq.size(); // Number of unique characters in t
    int formed = 0; // Number of unique characters formed in the current window
    int left = 0, right = 0; // Window pointers
    int minLen = INT_MAX, minLeft = -1, minRight = -1; // Variables to track the minimum window

This code maintains two pointers, `left` and `right`, which define the current window. It iterates through the string `s` using the `right` pointer to expand the window. Once all the characters in `t` are found in the current window, it tries to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer. Finally, it returns the minimum window substring found.

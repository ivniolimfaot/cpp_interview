### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : HashMap

HashMap, also known as unordered_map in C++, is a data structure that provides a mapping between keys and values. It offers fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. Here's an overview of how HashMap works in C++:

1. **Hash Function**: The core of a HashMap is a hash function. This function takes a key and returns a hash code, which is an integer value. The hash code is used to determine the index in the underlying array where the key-value pair will be stored.

2. **Bucket Array**: Internally, a HashMap consists of an array of linked lists (or some other data structure like trees in more advanced implementations) called buckets. Each bucket holds the key-value pairs that hash to the same index.

3. **Collision Handling**: Since different keys may hash to the same index (known as a collision), HashMaps must have a strategy for handling collisions. Common strategies include chaining and open addressing.

    * **Chaining**: In chaining, each bucket holds a linked list of key-value pairs that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, the new key-value pair is appended to the linked list.

    * **Open Addressing**: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the HashMap probes for an empty bucket by applying a secondary hash function or a linear probing strategy.

4. **Load Factor**: HashMaps typically have a load factor, which is the ratio of the number of elements stored in the HashMap to the number of buckets. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, the HashMap is resized to maintain efficiency.

5. **Operations**:

    * **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair, the key is hashed to find the index, and the pair is inserted into the appropriate bucket.

    * **Retrieval**: To retrieve a value associated with a key, the key is hashed to find the index, and then the corresponding bucket is searched for the key.

    * **Deletion**: To delete a key-value pair, the key is hashed to find the index, and then the corresponding bucket is searched for the key-value pair to be deleted.

HashMaps offer an average-case constant-time complexity O(1) for insertion, retrieval, and deletion operations, assuming a good hash function and a low collision rate. However, in the worst case, these operations can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the HashMap. Therefore, choosing an appropriate hash function and handling collisions effectively are crucial for HashMap performance. In C++, the standard library provides the unordered_map container, which implements HashMap functionality.

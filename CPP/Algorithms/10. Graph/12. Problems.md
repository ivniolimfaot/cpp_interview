### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): The Vertex Cover Problem

The Vertex Cover Problem is a classic problem in computer science and graph theory. In this problem, you're given an undirected graph, and the task is to find the smallest set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. This set of vertices is called the vertex cover of the graph.

Here's a basic approach to solve the Vertex Cover Problem using a simple algorithm:

#### Algorithm

1. Start with an empty set `VC` (Vertex Cover).
2. Repeat until all edges are covered:
   a. Pick an uncovered edge `(u, v)`.
   b. Add both `u` and `v` to `VC`.
3. Return `VC` as the minimum vertex cover.

#### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
    int V;
    vector<vector<int>> adj;

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V) {
        adj.resize(V);
    }

    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    vector<int> findVertexCover() {
        vector<int> vertexCover;
        unordered_set<int> coveredEdges;

        for (int u = 0; u < V; ++u) {
            for (int v : adj[u]) {
                if (coveredEdges.find(v) == coveredEdges.end()) {
                    // Add u and v to the vertex cover
                    vertexCover.push_back(u);
                    vertexCover.push_back(v);
                    coveredEdges.insert(u);
                    coveredEdges.insert(v);
                }
            }
        }

        return vertexCover;
    }
};

int main() {
    Graph g(5);
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 4);

    vector<int> vertexCover = g.findVertexCover();

    cout << "Minimum Vertex Cover: ";
    for (int v : vertexCover) {
        cout << v << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation of the algorithm in C++. You can optimize this algorithm further, especially for larger graphs, using more sophisticated data structures and algorithms like approximation algorithms or dynamic programming.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Remove Maximum Number of Edges

Removing the maximum number of edges from a graph typically involves finding a way to disconnect the maximum number of vertices while still keeping the graph connected. One common problem related to this is finding the maximum number of edges to remove to disconnect a tree. However, I'll provide a more general approach to remove the maximum number of edges from a graph in C++.

Here's a general outline of the approach:

1. **Representation of Graph**: You need a way to represent the graph. You can use an adjacency list or adjacency matrix depending on the size of the graph.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Start with any vertex of the graph and perform a DFS or BFS traversal. During the traversal, keep track of the number of vertices visited. This will give you an idea of the connected components of the graph.

3. **Count Edges to Remove**: After performing the traversal, you'll have an idea of the number of connected components in the graph. To maximize the number of removed edges, you typically want to disconnect the largest connected component from the rest of the graph. Calculate the number of edges you would need to remove to disconnect this largest component from the rest of the graph.

4. **Implementation**: Implement the necessary functions for graph representation, DFS/BFS traversal, and edge removal calculation.

Here's a simplified example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
    int V; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adj;

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V) {
        adj.resize(V);
    }

    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    // Depth First Search
    void DFSUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited, int& count) {
        visited[v] = true;
        count++;
        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u])
                DFSUtil(u, visited, count);
        }
    }

    int countEdgesToRemove() {
        vector<bool> visited(V, false);
        int max_count = 0;
        for (int v = 0; v < V; ++v) {
            if (!visited[v]) {
                int count = 0;
                DFSUtil(v, visited, count);
                max_count = max(max_count, count);
            }
        }
        return V - max_count;
    }
};

int main() {
    int n, m; // Number of vertices and edges
    cin >> n >> m;

    Graph g(n);

    // Read edges
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        g.addEdge(u, v);
    }

    cout << "Maximum number of edges to remove: " << g.countEdgesToRemove() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic example. Depending on your specific problem constraints and requirements, you might need to modify and optimize this code.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Longest Path

Finding the longest path in a graph is a challenging problem, especially for a general graph where cycles might be present. The problem is NP-hard, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithm exists to solve it for all general graphs. However, for certain types of graphs such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), this problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.

Here's a step-by-step explanation and implementation for finding the longest path in a DAG using C++.

#### Steps to Find the Longest Path in a DAG

1. **Topological Sorting**: Perform a topological sort of the DAG. Topological sorting of a graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge \( uv \) from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \), \( u \) comes before \( v \) in the ordering.

2. **Initialize Distances**: Initialize distances to all vertices as negative infinity (or a very small value) to indicate they are unreachable, except for the starting vertex which is set to 0.

3. **Relax Edges**: Process vertices in topological order, and for each vertex, update the distances of its adjacent vertices.

Here's the C++ code to implement this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
public:
    int V;
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;

    Graph(int V);
    void addEdge(int u, int v, int weight);
    void topologicalSortUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited, stack<int>& Stack);
    void longestPath(int s);
};

Graph::Graph(int V) {
    this->V = V;
    adj.resize(V);
}

void Graph::addEdge(int u, int v, int weight) {
    adj[u].push_back(make_pair(v, weight));
}

void Graph::topologicalSortUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited, stack<int>& Stack) {
    visited[v] = true;
    for (auto& neighbor : adj[v]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor.first]) {
            topologicalSortUtil(neighbor.first, visited, Stack);
        }
    }
    Stack.push(v);
}

void Graph::longestPath(int s) {
    stack<int> Stack;
    vector<bool> visited(V, false);
    vector<int> dist(V, INT_MIN);

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            topologicalSortUtil(i, visited, Stack);
        }
    }

    dist[s] = 0;

    while (!Stack.empty()) {
        int u = Stack.top();
        Stack.pop();

        if (dist[u] != INT_MIN) {
            for (auto& neighbor : adj[u]) {
                if (dist[neighbor.first] < dist[u] + neighbor.second) {
                    dist[neighbor.first] = dist[u] + neighbor.second;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (dist[i] == INT_MIN) {
            cout << "INF ";
        } else {
            cout << dist[i] << " ";
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    Graph g(6);
    g.addEdge(0, 1, 5);
    g.addEdge(0, 2, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 3, 6);
    g.addEdge(1, 2, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 4, 4);
    g.addEdge(2, 5, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 3, 7);
    g.addEdge(3, 5, 1);
    g.addEdge(3, 4, -1);
    g.addEdge(4, 5, -2);

    int s = 1;
    cout << "Following are the longest distances from source vertex " << s << ":\n";
    g.longestPath(s);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Class**: The `Graph` class contains methods for adding edges, performing topological sort, and finding the longest path.

2. **addEdge Method**: Adds a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v` with a given weight.

3. **topologicalSortUtil Method**: A utility function for topological sorting. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to visit nodes and push them onto a stack in topological order.

4. **longestPath Method**: Implements the dynamic programming approach to find the longest path:
    - Performs topological sort.
    - Initializes distances from the source to all vertices.
    - Processes each vertex in topological order to relax edges and update distances.

5. **Main Function**: Creates a graph, adds edges, and calls `longestPath` from a given source vertex.

This approach ensures that the longest path is found in linear time \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges, making it efficient for DAGs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Longest Possible Route

To solve the "Longest Possible Route" problem using C++, you need to find the longest path from a given starting point to a destination point in a matrix, without revisiting any cell. This problem is typically solved using a backtracking approach.

Here’s a step-by-step plan for solving the problem:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: Given a matrix with cells that can be either passable (represented by 1) or blocked (represented by 0), find the longest possible path from a given starting cell (x1, y1) to a destination cell (x2, y2) without revisiting any cell.

2. **Constraints**:
   - You can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
   - You cannot move to a cell that is blocked or revisit a cell.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use recursion to explore all possible paths from the starting point to the destination. At each step, mark the current cell as visited and move to the next cell if it is within bounds and not blocked. Keep track of the length of the current path and update the maximum length if the destination is reached.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a function `findLongestPath` that takes the matrix, start and end coordinates, and an auxiliary matrix to keep track of visited cells.
   - Use a helper function `findLongestPathUtil` to perform the backtracking.
   - At each step, explore all four possible moves (up, down, left, right).
   - If the destination is reached, update the maximum length.
   - Backtrack by unmarking the current cell as visited and return the maximum length found.

Here’s the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Utility function to check if a cell is valid (inside the grid and not blocked)
bool isValid(vector<vector<int>>& mat, vector<vector<bool>>& visited, int row, int col) {
    return (row >= 0) && (row < mat.size()) && (col >= 0) && (col < mat[0].size()) &&
           mat[row][col] == 1 && !visited[row][col];
}

// Utility function to find the longest path
void findLongestPathUtil(vector<vector<int>>& mat, vector<vector<bool>>& visited,
                         int i, int j, int x, int y, int& maxDist, int dist) {
    // If destination (x, y) is reached
    if (i == x && j == y) {
        maxDist = max(maxDist, dist);
        return;
    }

    // Mark the current cell as visited
    visited[i][j] = true;

    // Move up
    if (isValid(mat, visited, i - 1, j)) {
        findLongestPathUtil(mat, visited, i - 1, j, x, y, maxDist, dist + 1);
    }

    // Move down
    if (isValid(mat, visited, i + 1, j)) {
        findLongestPathUtil(mat, visited, i + 1, j, x, y, maxDist, dist + 1);
    }

    // Move left
    if (isValid(mat, visited, i, j - 1)) {
        findLongestPathUtil(mat, visited, i, j - 1, x, y, maxDist, dist + 1);
    }

    // Move right
    if (isValid(mat, visited, i, j + 1)) {
        findLongestPathUtil(mat, visited, i, j + 1, x, y, maxDist, dist + 1);
    }

    // Backtrack: unmark the current cell as visited
    visited[i][j] = false;
}

// Function to find the longest possible route in a matrix
int findLongestPath(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int i, int j, int x, int y) {
    if (mat[i][j] == 0 || mat[x][y] == 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Create a visited matrix
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(mat.size(), vector<bool>(mat[0].size(), false));

    int maxDist = 0;
    findLongestPathUtil(mat, visited, i, j, x, y, maxDist, 0);

    return maxDist;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {
        { 1, 1, 1, 0, 1 },
        { 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 },
        { 1, 1, 1, 0, 1 },
        { 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 },
        { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }
    };

    int i = 0, j = 0;  // Starting coordinates
    int x = 4, y = 4;  // Destination coordinates

    int maxDist = findLongestPath(mat, i, j, x, y);

    if (maxDist != -1) {
        cout << "The longest path from (" << i << ", " << j << ") to (" << x << ", " << y << ") is " << maxDist << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No path exists from (" << i << ", " << j << ") to (" << x << ", " << y << ")" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- **isValid Function**: Checks if a move is valid by ensuring the cell is within bounds, not blocked, and not visited.
- **findLongestPathUtil Function**: Recursively explores all possible moves, updating the maximum distance if the destination is reached. It uses backtracking to mark and unmark cells as visited.
- **findLongestPath Function**: Initializes the visited matrix and calls the utility function to find the longest path. It handles the edge case where the start or destination cell is blocked.

This code will correctly find the longest path in the matrix from the given start to the destination, ensuring no cell is revisited.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Find Biconnected Components

Finding Biconnected Components (BCCs) in a graph is an important problem in computer science, particularly in the areas of network reliability and connectivity. A Biconnected Component of a graph is a maximal biconnected subgraph, meaning there are no vertices whose removal would disconnect the subgraph.

Here's how to find Biconnected Components in an undirected graph using Tarjan's algorithm. The algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) and keeps track of discovery and low values to identify articulation points and biconnected components.

#### Steps for Tarjan's Algorithm to Find Biconnected Components

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `disc[]` (discovery time of each vertex)
   - `low[]` (earliest visited vertex reachable from the subtree rooted with the vertex)
   - `parent[]` (to store the parent vertices in DFS tree)
   - `stack[]` (to store the edges)
   - `time` (to keep track of the discovery time)
   - `bcc` (to store the BCCs)

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the graph.
   - For each vertex, update its discovery and low values.
   - For each adjacent vertex, update the low value based on the discovery times and low values of the adjacent vertices.

3. **Identify Articulation Points and BCCs:**
   - An articulation point is identified if:
     - The root of DFS tree has two or more children.
     - Any other vertex u has a child v such that no vertex in the subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of u's ancestors.
   - When an articulation point is found, pop edges from the stack until the edge `(u, v)` is reached. The edges form a biconnected component.

#### Implementation in C++

Below is a complete C++ implementation for finding Biconnected Components using Tarjan's Algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
#define NIL -1

using namespace std;

class Graph {
    int V;    // Number of vertices
    list<int> *adj;    // A dynamic array of adjacency lists

    void BCCUtil(int u, int disc[], int low[], list<pair<int, int>> *st, int parent[]);

public:
    Graph(int V);
    void addEdge(int v, int w);
    void BCC();    // Prints Biconnected Components
};

Graph::Graph(int V) {
    this->V = V;
    adj = new list<int>[V];
}

void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w) {
    adj[v].push_back(w);
    adj[w].push_back(v);    // The graph is undirected
}

void Graph::BCCUtil(int u, int disc[], int low[], list<pair<int, int>> *st, int parent[]) {
    static int time = 0;
    disc[u] = low[u] = ++time;
    int children = 0;

    for (auto v : adj[u]) {
        if (disc[v] == NIL) {
            children++;
            parent[v] = u;
            st->push_back(make_pair(u, v));
            BCCUtil(v, disc, low, st, parent);

            low[u] = min(low[u], low[v]);

            if ((disc[u] == 1 && children > 1) || (disc[u] > 1 && low[v] >= disc[u])) {
                while (st->back() != make_pair(u, v)) {
                    cout << st->back().first << "--" << st->back().second << " ";
                    st->pop_back();
                }
                cout << st->back().first << "--" << st->back().second << endl;
                st->pop_back();
            }
        } else if (v != parent[u] && disc[v] < disc[u]) {
            low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v]);
            st->push_back(make_pair(u, v));
        }
    }
}

void Graph::BCC() {
    int *disc = new int[V];
    int *low = new int[V];
    int *parent = new int[V];
    list<pair<int, int>> *st = new list<pair<int, int>>[V];

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        disc[i] = NIL;
        low[i] = NIL;
        parent[i] = NIL;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
        if (disc[i] == NIL) {
            BCCUtil(i, disc, low, st, parent);
            while (!st->empty()) {
                cout << st->back().first << "--" << st->back().second << " ";
                st->pop_back();
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    Graph g(12);
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(1, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 0);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 4);
    g.addEdge(4, 5);
    g.addEdge(5, 3);

    g.addEdge(10, 11);
    g.addEdge(11, 9);

    g.BCC();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- **Graph Construction:**
  - `Graph` class constructor initializes the adjacency list.
  - `addEdge` method adds an edge between two vertices in the undirected graph.

- **BCCUtil Function:**
  - Performs a DFS traversal of the graph.
  - Updates discovery and low values.
  - Identifies articulation points and BCCs.
  - Uses a stack to store edges of the current BCC.

- **BCC Function:**
  - Initializes discovery and low values.
  - Iterates over all vertices to ensure all components are covered.
  - Calls `BCCUtil` for each unvisited vertex.
  - Outputs the biconnected components.

#### Usage

- Compile and run the program.
- The graph is initialized with vertices and edges.
- The `BCC` function prints out the biconnected components of the graph.

This implementation provides a robust way to find biconnected components in an undirected graph using Tarjan's algorithm, ensuring efficient and accurate identification of articulation points and biconnected components.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Graphs: List of Depths

#### Problem Statement: List of Depths

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you’ll have D linked lists).

##### Input

- A binary tree where each node contains an integer value and pointers to left and right child nodes.

##### Output

- An array (or list) of linked lists. Each linked list contains nodes at the same depth from the root.

#### Detailed Explanation

1. **Binary Tree Node Structure**:
    - Each node in the binary tree will have the following structure:

    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode* left;
        TreeNode* right;
        TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
    };
    ```

2. **Linked List Node Structure**:
    - Each node in the linked list will have the following structure:

    ```cpp
    struct ListNode {
        int val;
        ListNode* next;
        ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
    };
    ```

3. **Algorithm**:
    - Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level.
    - For each level, create a new linked list and add all nodes at that depth to the list.
    - Continue this process until all levels of the tree are processed.

4. **Steps**:
    1. Initialize a queue to hold nodes and their corresponding depth.
    2. Initialize an array or vector to hold the linked lists for each depth.
    3. Start from the root node, add it to the queue with depth 0.
    4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
        - Dequeue the front element (node and its depth).
        - If the depth is equal to the size of the list of linked lists, create a new linked list for this depth.
        - Append the node to the corresponding linked list.
        - Enqueue the left and right children of the node with depth +1.
    5. Return the array of linked lists.

#### Example

Given the following binary tree:

```bash
       1
      / \
     2   3
    / \   \
   4   5   6
```

The output will be an array of linked lists:

- Depth 0: 1 -> NULL
- Depth 1: 2 -> 3 -> NULL
- Depth 2: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL

#### C++ Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// TreeNode structure definition
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// ListNode structure definition
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

// Function to create linked lists of all nodes at each depth
vector<ListNode*> listOfDepths(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<ListNode*> result;
    if (root == NULL) return result;

    queue<pair<TreeNode*, int>> q;
    q.push({root, 0});

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* node = q.front().first;
        int depth = q.front().second;
        q.pop();

        // If this depth is not yet in result, add a new linked list
        if (result.size() == depth) {
            result.push_back(new ListNode(node->val));
        } else {
            // Append to the existing linked list
            ListNode* current = result[depth];
            while (current->next != NULL) {
                current = current->next;
            }
            current->next = new ListNode(node->val);
        }

        // Enqueue children with incremented depth
        if (node->left != NULL) {
            q.push({node->left, depth + 1});
        }
        if (node->right != NULL) {
            q.push({node->right, depth + 1});
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Function to print the linked lists
void printListOfDepths(const vector<ListNode*>& lists) {
    for (int i = 0; i < lists.size(); ++i) {
        ListNode* head = lists[i];
        cout << "Depth " << i << ": ";
        while (head != NULL) {
            cout << head->val << " -> ";
            head = head->next;
        }
        cout << "NULL" << endl;
    }
}

// Main function to test the listOfDepths function
int main() {
    // Construct the binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    // Get the list of depths
    vector<ListNode*> lists = listOfDepths(root);

    // Print the lists
    printListOfDepths(lists);

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- The `listOfDepths` function creates an array of linked lists, each representing the nodes at a particular depth.
- The `printListOfDepths` function is used to print the resulting linked lists for verification.

This implementation ensures that nodes are grouped by their depth in the tree, and each depth has its own linked list, maintaining the required structure and order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Transitive closure of a directed graph and Path Matrix

To compute the transitive closure of a directed graph and the path matrix in C++, you can use algorithms like Warshall's algorithm. Here's a brief explanation of the algorithm and its implementation:

#### Warshall's Algorithm

Warshall's algorithm is a classical method for finding the transitive closure of a directed graph. It's based on dynamic programming and works by iteratively updating a matrix representing the reachability between pairs of vertices.

Here's the high-level idea:

1. Initialize a matrix `reach[][]` where `reach[i][j]` will be 1 if vertex `j` is reachable from vertex `i`, and 0 otherwise.
2. Initialize `reach[][]` with the adjacency matrix of the given graph.
3. For each vertex `k`, check if vertex `k` can be reached from vertex `i` and vertex `j` can be reached from vertex `k`. If so, set `reach[i][j]` to 1.
4. After completing the process for all vertices, `reach[][]` will contain the transitive closure of the graph.

##### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void transitiveClosure(const vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<vector<int>>& reach) {
    int V = graph.size();

    // Initialize reach[][] with the adjacency matrix of the graph
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; ++j) {
            reach[i][j] = graph[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Compute transitive closure using Warshall's algorithm
    for (int k = 0; k < V; ++k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < V; ++j) {
                reach[i][j] = reach[i][j] || (reach[i][k] && reach[k][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example graph represented using adjacency matrix
    vector<vector<int>> graph = {
        {0, 1, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 1},
        {0, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 1, 0}
    };
    int V = graph.size();

    // Initialize a matrix to store the transitive closure
    vector<vector<int>> reach(V, vector<int>(V, 0));

    // Compute transitive closure
    transitiveClosure(graph, reach);

    // Output the transitive closure matrix
    cout << "Transitive Closure:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < V; ++j) {
            cout << reach[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes a graph and computes its transitive closure using Warshall's algorithm. You can extend this code to also compute the path matrix if needed. The path matrix represents the length of the shortest path between every pair of vertices in the graph.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Shortest Path by Topological Sort

Using topological sorting to find the shortest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a classic algorithmic technique. The basic idea is to perform a topological sort on the graph, then relax each edge in topological order. This ensures that when you relax an edge (u, v), node u has already been processed, guaranteeing that the shortest path to u has been found before considering v.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this algorithm in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

const int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();

// Directed edge
struct Edge {
    int to, weight;
    Edge(int t, int w) : to(t), weight(w) {}
};

// Graph represented using adjacency list
class Graph {
    int V; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<Edge>> adj;

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V), adj(V) {}

    // Add directed edge
    void addEdge(int from, int to, int weight) {
        adj[from].emplace_back(to, weight);
    }

    // Topological sort
    void topologicalSortUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited, stack<int>& stack) {
        visited[v] = true;
        for (const auto& edge : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[edge.to])
                topologicalSortUtil(edge.to, visited, stack);
        }
        stack.push(v);
    }

    vector<int> shortestPath(int src) {
        stack<int> stack;
        vector<bool> visited(V, false);

        // Perform topological sort
        for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i])
                topologicalSortUtil(i, visited, stack);
        }

        // Initialize distances to all vertices as infinite and
        // distance to source as 0
        vector<int> dist(V, INF);
        dist[src] = 0;

        // Process vertices in topological order
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int u = stack.top();
            stack.pop();

            // Update distances to all adjacent vertices of the popped vertex
            for (const auto& edge : adj[u]) {
                int v = edge.to;
                int weight = edge.weight;
                if (dist[u] != INF && dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                }
            }
        }

        return dist;
    }
};

int main() {
    int V, E; // Number of vertices and edges
    cin >> V >> E;

    Graph graph(V);

    // Input format: from to weight
    for (int i = 0; i < E; ++i) {
        int from, to, weight;
        cin >> from >> to >> weight;
        graph.addEdge(from, to, weight);
    }

    int src; // Source vertex
    cin >> src;

    vector<int> shortestDistances = graph.shortestPath(src);

    // Output shortest distances from source vertex
    cout << "Shortest distances from vertex " << src << ":\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
        cout << "Vertex " << i << ": ";
        if (shortestDistances[i] == INF)
            cout << "INF\n";
        else
            cout << shortestDistances[i] << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `Edge` struct represents a directed edge with a destination vertex `to` and a weight.
- The `Graph` class represents the graph using an adjacency list and provides methods to add edges and compute the shortest path.
- The `topologicalSortUtil` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal and pushes vertices onto a stack based on their finishing times.
- The `shortestPath` function first performs topological sorting, then iterates over the vertices in topological order and relaxes all outgoing edges.
- The `main` function reads the input graph and source vertex, then prints the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices.

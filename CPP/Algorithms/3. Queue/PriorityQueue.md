### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : Priority Queue

A Priority Queue is a data structure similar to a regular queue, but each element in the queue has a priority associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. This means that elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `std::priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(15);

    // Accessing the top element of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Top element of the priority queue: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after popping: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* We include the necessary header files (`#include <iostream>` and `#include <queue>`).
* We declare a priority queue `pq` of integers (`std::priority_queue<int>`).
* We insert elements into the priority queue using the `push()` method.
* We access the top element of the priority queue using the `top()` method.
* We remove the top element from the priority queue using the `pop()` method.
* Finally, we access the new top element after popping.

The priority queue in C++ is implemented as a max-heap by default, meaning that the element with the highest value has the highest priority. If you want to change the priority queue to behave like a min-heap, where the element with the lowest value has the highest priority, you can specify a different comparison function as the second template parameter of `std::priority_queue`. For example:

```cpp
// Declaration of a priority queue of integers, with a custom comparison function
std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;
```

This declaration creates a priority queue of integers where the element with the smallest value has the highest priority.

Priority queues are commonly used in algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in graphs and in implementing algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees. They are also used in various scheduling algorithms and in simulating systems where tasks have different priorities.


### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are Priority Queues ?

Priority queues are abstract data types similar to regular queues but with an added priority associated with each element. In a priority queue, elements are removed based on their priority rather than the order in which they were added.

In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority value, and elements with higher priority values are dequeued before elements with lower priority values. Priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, which allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest (or lowest, depending on the implementation) priority element.

In C++, priority queues are provided as part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and can be found in the `<queue>` header. They are implemented as container adaptors, meaning they internally use a container such as a vector or a deque to manage the elements, and provide a high-level interface for operations like insertion and deletion based on priority.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of priority queues in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print elements of the priority queue
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, elements (integers) are inserted into the priority queue using the `push()` method, and then they are printed in sorted order (highest to lowest) using the `top()` method to access the highest priority element and `pop()` method to remove it from the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are priority queues?

Priority queues are a type of data structure used in computer science to store elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority, and elements with higher priorities are dequeued before those with lower priorities.

In C++, priority queues are typically implemented using binary heaps, although other data structures like Fibonacci heaps can also be used. Binary heaps are complete binary trees where each node satisfies the heap property, meaning that the priority of a parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the priorities of its children.

C++ provides a `std::priority_queue` container adapter in the `<queue>` header that implements a priority queue using a binary heap. It allows elements to be inserted with a specified priority and supports operations like insertion, extraction of the top element, and checking whether the priority queue is empty.

Here's a basic example of how to use `std::priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a max priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> maxPriorityQueue;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    maxPriorityQueue.push(30);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(10);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(50);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    maxPriorityQueue.pop();

    // Printing the top element again
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `maxPriorityQueue` is a priority queue that stores integers in a max heap, so the element with the highest value will have the highest priority. The `push()` function is used to insert elements, `top()` retrieves the highest priority element without removing it, and `pop()` removes the highest priority element from the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Ways to implement Priority Queue

In C++, there are several ways to implement a priority queue, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few common methods:

1. **Using Standard Template Library (STL)**:
   The simplest way to implement a priority queue in C++ is to use the `std::priority_queue` class provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). It internally uses a heap data structure to maintain the elements in priority order. Here's a basic example:

   ```cpp
   #include <queue>

   int main() {
       std::priority_queue<int> pq;

       pq.push(5);
       pq.push(2);
       pq.push(10);

       while (!pq.empty()) {
           std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
           pq.pop();
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This would output: `10 5 2`

2. **Using Heap Operations**:
   You can also implement a priority queue using heap operations directly, without relying on the `std::priority_queue` class. This gives you more control over the underlying data structure. You can implement your own heap or use functions like `std::make_heap`, `std::push_heap`, and `std::pop_heap`. Here's a simple example:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <algorithm>

   int main() {
       std::vector<int> heap = {5, 2, 10};

       std::make_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());

       while (!heap.empty()) {
           std::cout << heap.front() << " ";
           std::pop_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
           heap.pop_back();
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This would also output: `10 5 2`

3. **Using Binary Search Trees (BST)**:
   Another approach is to use a binary search tree (BST) to implement a priority queue. You can use a self-balancing BST like AVL tree or Red-Black tree to maintain the elements in sorted order. This approach allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining sorted order. However, it may not provide the same performance guarantees as using a heap-based approach.

4. **Using an Array or Linked List**:
   While less efficient, you can implement a priority queue using an array or linked list and manually maintain the sorted order of elements. However, this approach typically has worse time complexity for operations like insertion and deletion compared to heap-based implementations.

The choice of implementation depends on factors such as the specific requirements of your application, expected performance characteristics, and ease of implementation. Typically, for most use cases, the `std::priority_queue` from the STL suffices due to its simplicity and good performance characteristics.

    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print elements of the priority queue
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, elements (integers) are inserted into the priority queue using the `push()` method, and then they are printed in sorted order (highest to lowest) using the `top()` method to access the highest priority element and `pop()` method to remove it from the queue.

    maxPriorityQueue.push(10);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(50);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    maxPriorityQueue.pop();

    // Printing the top element again
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;

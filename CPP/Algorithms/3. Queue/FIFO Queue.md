### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Algorithm for FIFO Queue

Certainly! A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue is a data structure that operates on the principle that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. It's analogous to a queue of people waiting in line: the person who arrived first is the one who gets served first.

In C++, you can implement a FIFO queue using various underlying data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or deques. Here's a simple implementation using a linked list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
class Node {
public:
    T data;
    Node* next;

    Node(T data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
};

template<typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    Node<T>* front;
    Node<T>* rear;
    int size;

public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr), size(0) {}

    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty()) {
            dequeue();
        }
    }

    void enqueue(T data) {
        Node<T>* newNode = new Node<T>(data);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
        size++;
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
            return;
        }
        Node<T>* temp = front;
        front = front->next;
        delete temp;
        size--;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            rear = nullptr;
        }
    }

    T peek() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. Cannot peek.\n";
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        return front->data;
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return size == 0;
    }

    int getSize() const {
        return size;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Queue size: " << q.getSize() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Front element: " << q.peek() << std::endl;

    q.dequeue();
    std::cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << q.peek() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple FIFO queue using a singly linked list. It includes operations such as `enqueue` to add elements to the queue, `dequeue` to remove elements from the front of the queue, `peek` to see the front element without removing it, and `isEmpty` and `getSize` to check the state of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Dry run the FIFO queue algorithm

Sure, let's dry run the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue algorithm in C++. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a queue
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Enqueue elements
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);
    myQueue.push(40);

    // Displaying the elements of the queue
    std::cout << "Queue elements: ";
    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << myQueue.front() << " ";
        myQueue.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Now, let's dry run this code step by step:

1. **Initialization**: We create a queue named `myQueue` of type `int`.

2. **Enqueue Elements**: We add elements to the queue using the `push()` function:
   * `myQueue.push(10)` adds 10 to the queue.
   * `myQueue.push(20)` adds 20 to the queue.
   * `myQueue.push(30)` adds 30 to the queue.
   * `myQueue.push(40)` adds 40 to the queue.

   Now the queue looks like this: `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.

3. **Dequeue and Display**: We iterate through the queue using a while loop until the queue is empty:
   * In the first iteration: `myQueue.front()` returns the front element of the queue, which is 10. We print 10 and then remove it from the queue using `myQueue.pop()`.
   * In the second iteration: `myQueue.front()` returns the front element of the queue, which is now 20. We print 20 and then remove it from the queue.
   * In the third iteration: `myQueue.front()` returns the front element of the queue, which is now 30. We print 30 and then remove it from the queue.
   * In the fourth iteration: `myQueue.front()` returns the front element of the queue, which is now 40. We print 40 and then remove it from the queue.

4. **Empty Check**: After all elements are dequeued, the queue becomes empty (`myQueue.empty()` returns `true`).

5. **Output**: The program prints:

   ```bash
   Queue elements: 10 20 30 40
   ```

And that's the dry run of the FIFO queue algorithm in C++. It follows the principle of First-In-First-Out, meaning the element added first is the one to be removed first.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): FIFO Queue Algorithm understanding

A FIFO (First In, First Out) queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on the principle that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. It follows the same principle as standing in a line: the first person to arrive at the line is the first one to leave.

In C++, you can implement a FIFO queue using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, or the standard library's `std::queue`. Let's see how you can implement a FIFO queue using a simple array-based approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

const int MAX_SIZE = 100; // Maximum size of the queue

class Queue {
private:
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];
    int front, rear;

public:
    Queue() {
        front = -1; // Initialize front and rear
        rear = -1;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == -1 && rear == -1;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is full
    bool isFull() {
        return rear == MAX_SIZE - 1;
    }

    // Function to add an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int x) {
        if (isFull()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is full. Cannot enqueue element.\n";
            return;
        }
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = 0; // If queue is empty, set front and rear to 0
        } else {
            rear++;
        }
        arr[rear] = x;
    }

    // Function to remove an element from the queue
    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue element.\n";
            return;
        }
        if (front == rear) {
            // If only one element is present, reset front and rear to -1
            front = rear = -1;
        } else {
            front++;
        }
    }

    // Function to get the front element of the queue
    int frontElement() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. No front element.\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return arr[front];
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Front element: " << q.frontElement() << std::endl;

    q.dequeue();
    std::cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << q.frontElement() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

* We use an array `arr` to store the elements of the queue.
* `front` and `rear` are indices to keep track of the front and rear of the queue.
* `enqueue()` adds an element to the rear of the queue.
* `dequeue()` removes an element from the front of the queue.
* `frontElement()` returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
* `isEmpty()` and `isFull()` are helper functions to check if the queue is empty or full, respectively.

This implementation provides a basic understanding of how a FIFO queue works in C++. It's important to note that this is a simple implementation; in real-world scenarios, you might want to use the `std::queue` from the C++ standard library for more robust and efficient FIFO queue operations.

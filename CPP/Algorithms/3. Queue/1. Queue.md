### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue (Theory)

A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It operates much like a line of people waiting for a service, where the person who arrives first is served first. In a queue, elements are added at the back (called enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called dequeue operation).

#### Properties of a Queue

1. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: The element that is added first is the one to be removed first.

2. **Linear Data Structure**: A queue is a linear data structure, meaning its elements are arranged in a sequence.

3. **Dynamic Size**: A queue can dynamically grow or shrink to accommodate the elements being enqueued or dequeued.

4. **Two Primary Operations**:
   - **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
   - **Dequeue**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.

5. **Supports Peek Operation**: Peek operation retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

#### Key Operations of a Queue

1. **Enqueue (Push)**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue (Pop)**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the front element of the queue.
4. **Rear**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of the queue.
5. **IsEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
6. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

#### Implementation

Queues can be implemented using various underlying data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. Here's a basic implementation of a queue using a linked list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* next;
        Node(const T& item) : data(item), next(nullptr) {}
    };
    Node* frontPtr;
    Node* rearPtr;
public:
    Queue() : frontPtr(nullptr), rearPtr(nullptr) {}

    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty())
            dequeue();
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return frontPtr == nullptr;
    }

    void enqueue(const T& item) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(item);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            frontPtr = rearPtr = newNode;
        } else {
            rearPtr->next = newNode;
            rearPtr = newNode;
        }
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            Node* temp = frontPtr;
            if (frontPtr == rearPtr) {
                frontPtr = rearPtr = nullptr;
            } else {
                frontPtr = frontPtr->next;
            }
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    const T& front() const {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            return frontPtr->data;
        }
        throw std::runtime_error("Queue is empty");
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Front of the queue: " << q.front() << std::endl;

    q.dequeue();

    std::cout << "Front of the queue after dequeue: " << q.front() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity

- Enqueue operation: O(1)
- Dequeue operation: O(1)
- Peek operation: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.

This is a basic overview of the queue data structure, its properties, applications, and a simple implementation in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue Applications

Queues, a fundamental data structure in computer science, are commonly used to manage tasks, data, or events in a FIFO (First In, First Out) manner. Here are several common applications of queues in C++:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores nodes in a graph level by level. Queues are used to keep track of the nodes to be visited, ensuring that nodes at the current level are processed before moving to the next level.

2. **Simulation**: Queues are often used in simulations to model real-world scenarios. For example, in a bank simulation, the queue represents the line of customers waiting to be served.

3. **Task Scheduling**: Queues are used to schedule tasks or jobs in various applications such as operating systems, where tasks are executed in the order they were received.

4. **Printer Queue**: In a printing system, documents are printed in the order they were sent to the printer, making queues a natural choice for managing print jobs.

5. **CPU Scheduling**: Queues are used in CPU scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, where processes are queued and executed in a cyclic manner.

6. **Call Center Management**: Queues are used in call centers to manage incoming calls. Callers are placed in a queue and served by available agents in the order they called.

7. **Buffering**: Queues are used as buffers in networking and I/O operations. Incoming data is stored in a queue until it can be processed.

8. **Bounded Buffer Problem**: In producer-consumer scenarios, where producers produce data and consumers consume it, queues can be used as a bounded buffer to coordinate between producers and consumers.

9. **Caching**: Queues can be used in caching mechanisms, such as the LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction policy, where the least recently accessed item is evicted from the cache.

10. **Event Handling**: Queues are used in event-driven programming to handle events such as user inputs, network events, or timer expirations. Events are queued and processed in the order they occur.

In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a ready-to-use queue container in the `<queue>` header, making it easy to implement these applications. Additionally, C++ allows you to create your own queue data structure using arrays, linked lists, or other underlying data structures. Depending on the specific application and requirements, you can choose the most suitable implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue STL

#### Operations Supported

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
2. **Pop**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Accesses the element at the front of the queue.
4. **Back**: Accesses the element at the back of the queue.
5. **Empty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
6. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

#### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaring a queue of integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Pushing elements into the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Accessing the front and back elements
    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl; // Outputs: 10
    std::cout << "Back element: " << myQueue.back() << std::endl;   // Outputs: 30

    // Popping an element
    myQueue.pop();

    // Checking if the queue is empty and its size
    std::cout << "Is queue empty? " << (myQueue.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Outputs: No
    std::cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.size() << std::endl;                        // Outputs: 2

    return 0;
}
```

#### Notes

- The `push` function adds elements to the back of the queue.
- The `pop` function removes the front element from the queue.
- Accessing front or back elements of an empty queue is undefined behavior, so it's always a good practice to check if the queue is empty before doing so.
- Queues are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to process elements in the order they were added, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search, etc.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue using 2 Stacks

Implementing a queue using two stacks is a common interview question that tests your understanding of data structures. Here's how you can do it in C++:

#### Key Concept

- A queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- A stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- By using two stacks, you can simulate the behavior of a queue.

#### Algorithm

- **Enqueue (push)**: Simply push the new element onto the first stack.
- **Dequeue (pop)**: If the second stack is empty, move all elements from the first stack to the second stack. Then pop the top element from the second stack.

#### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    stack<T> s1, s2;

public:
    void enqueue(T x) {
        // Push item into the first stack
        s1.push(x);
    }

    T dequeue() {
        if (s2.empty()) {
            // If second stack is empty, move all elements from first stack to second stack
            while (!s1.empty()) {
                s2.push(s1.top());
                s1.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // If second stack is still empty, queue is empty
        if (s2.empty()) {
            throw runtime_error("Queue is empty");
        }

        // Pop the element from second stack
        T topVal = s2.top();
        s2.pop();
        return topVal;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return s1.empty() && s2.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> q;

    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 2

    q.enqueue(4);
    
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 4

    // Uncommenting the next line will throw an exception since the queue is empty
    // cout << q.dequeue() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Enqueue Operation**:
    - Push the element onto `s1`.

2. **Dequeue Operation**:
    - If `s2` is empty, move all elements from `s1` to `s2`.
    - Pop the top element from `s2`.

3. **isEmpty Operation**:
    - Check if both `s1` and `s2` are empty.

#### Points to Note

- The `dequeue` operation may involve moving elements between stacks, which can be costly. However, each element is moved at most once between the stacks, resulting in an amortized time complexity of O(1) for both enqueue and dequeue operations.

This implementation efficiently simulates a queue using two stacks and is a good example of leveraging the properties of one data structure to implement another.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue: Weave

In the context of algorithms and data structures, particularly in C++, a "queue weave" can be understood as an operation that interlaces two queues into one. This process takes elements alternately from each queue and places them into a new queue. Below is a detailed explanation and a sample implementation of the "queue weave" using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

#### Explanation

Given two queues, \( q1 \) and \( q2 \), the goal is to create a new queue, \( q3 \), that contains elements from \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) in an alternating fashion. If one queue is longer than the other, the remaining elements from the longer queue will be appended to the end of \( q3 \).

#### Steps to Implement the Queue Weave

1. Initialize an empty queue \( q3 \).
2. While both \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) are not empty, alternate taking elements from \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) and push them to \( q3 \).
3. If \( q1 \) still has elements after \( q2 \) is empty, append the remaining elements of \( q1 \) to \( q3 \).
4. If \( q2 \) still has elements after \( q1 \) is empty, append the remaining elements of \( q2 \) to \( q3 \).

#### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Function to weave two queues into one
std::queue<int> weaveQueues(std::queue<int>& q1, std::queue<int>& q2) {
    std::queue<int> q3; // Resultant queue

    // Weave the queues
    while (!q1.empty() && !q2.empty()) {
        q3.push(q1.front());
        q1.pop();
        q3.push(q2.front());
        q2.pop();
    }

    // If q1 still has elements, add them to q3
    while (!q1.empty()) {
        q3.push(q1.front());
        q1.pop();
    }

    // If q2 still has elements, add them to q3
    while (!q2.empty()) {
        q3.push(q2.front());
        q2.pop();
    }

    return q3;
}

int main() {
    // Example queues
    std::queue<int> q1;
    std::queue<int> q2;

    // Fill q1 with some elements
    q1.push(1);
    q1.push(3);
    q1.push(5);

    // Fill q2 with some elements
    q2.push(2);
    q2.push(4);
    q2.push(6);
    q2.push(8);

    // Weave the queues
    std::queue<int> q3 = weaveQueues(q1, q2);

    // Print the elements of the resultant queue
    std::cout << "Weaved Queue: ";
    while (!q3.empty()) {
        std::cout << q3.front() << " ";
        q3.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code

1. **Header Files**: The code includes `<iostream>` for input-output operations and `<queue>` for using the queue data structure from STL.
2. **Function Definition**: The `weaveQueues` function takes two references to `std::queue<int>` and returns a new queue with elements weaved.
3. **While Loop**: The first while loop interlaces elements from both queues until one of them is empty.
4. **Remaining Elements**: The next two while loops handle the remaining elements of the non-empty queue.
5. **Main Function**: Initializes two example queues, fills them with elements, and calls the `weaveQueues` function. The result is then printed.

This implementation ensures that elements from both queues are interleaved correctly, and any remaining elements from the longer queue are appended to the result.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Reverse a queue

To reverse a queue in C++, you can use another auxiliary data structure, like a stack, to temporarily store the elements of the queue in reverse order. Here's how you can implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Function to reverse a queue
void reverseQueue(queue<int> &q) {
    stack<int> s;
    
    // Push elements of queue into stack
    while (!q.empty()) {
        s.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    
    // Pop elements from stack and push them back into the queue
    while (!s.empty()) {
        q.push(s.top());
        s.pop();
    }
}

// Function to print a queue
void printQueue(queue<int> q) {
    while (!q.empty()) {
        cout << q.front() << " ";
        q.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create a queue
    queue<int> q;
    
    // Push elements into the queue
    q.push(1);
    q.push(2);
    q.push(3);
    q.push(4);
    q.push(5);
    
    cout << "Original queue: ";
    printQueue(q);
    
    // Reverse the queue
    reverseQueue(q);
    
    cout << "Reversed queue: ";
    printQueue(q);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We use a stack to reverse the order of elements in the queue. We first push all elements of the queue into the stack.
2. Then, we pop elements from the stack and push them back into the queue. Since stacks follow a last in, first out (LIFO) order, this effectively reverses the order of elements.
3. Finally, we have helper functions `printQueue()` to print the elements of the queue before and after the reversal.

This code will output:

```bash
Original queue: 1 2 3 4 5 
Reversed queue: 5 4 3 2 1 
```

And the queue is successfully reversed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implement Queue Using ONE stack

Implementing a queue using only one stack in C++ involves a clever manipulation of the stack operations. The idea is to simulate the behavior of a queue using just one stack. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class Queue {
private:
    stack<int> s1;

public:
    void enqueue(int x) {
        s1.push(x); // Push element to stack
    }

    int dequeue() {
        if (s1.empty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // Or throw an exception
        }

        int x = s1.top();
        s1.pop();

        if (s1.empty()) // If this was the last element, return
            return x;
        
        int item = dequeue(); // Recursively dequeue until the last element
        s1.push(x); // Push back elements after recursion
        
        return item;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return s1.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 2
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: Queue is empty!

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `enqueue()` operation simply pushes the element onto the stack.
- The `dequeue()` operation is a bit tricky. It recursively dequeues elements until the last element of the stack is reached. Then, it pops that last element and returns it. During the recursion, elements are popped and pushed back onto the stack, effectively reversing their order.
- `isEmpty()` checks if the stack is empty.

- `isEmpty()` checks if the stack is empty.

Keep in mind that this implementation has some limitations and may not be as efficient as using two stacks or other queue implementations, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. However, it demonstrates the concept of implementing a queue using one stack.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Interleave two halves of a queue [RETURN]

To interleave two halves of a queue in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the queue into two halves.
2. Interleave the elements of the two halves.
3. Merge the interleaved halves back into the original queue.

Here's a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Function to interleave two halves of a queue
void interleave(queue<int>& q) {
    // Step 1: Split the queue into two halves
    int size = q.size();
    int half_size = size / 2;

    queue<int> first_half, second_half;
    for (int i = 0; i < half_size; ++i) {
        first_half.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    while (!q.empty()) {
        second_half.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }

    // Step 2: Interleave the elements of the two halves
    while (!first_half.empty()) {
        q.push(second_half.front());
        second_half.pop();
        q.push(first_half.front());
        first_half.pop();
    }

    // Step 3: Merge the interleaved halves back into the original queue
    while (!second_half.empty()) {
        q.push(second_half.front());
        second_half.pop();
    }
}

// Function to print the elements of a queue
void printQueue(queue<int> q) {
    while (!q.empty()) {
        cout << q.front() << " ";
        q.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    queue<int> q;
    // Push elements into the queue
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        q.push(i);
    }

    cout << "Original Queue: ";
    printQueue(q);

    interleave(q);

    cout << "Interleaved Queue: ";
    printQueue(q);

    return 0;
}
```

This code first splits the queue into two halves, then interleave the elements of the two halves, and finally merges the interleaved halves back into the original queue. You can test it by running the `main` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): DEQueue ( Double-Ended-Queue )

A double-ended queue, often abbreviated as deque (pronounced "deck"), is a versatile data structure that supports insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the back. It combines the features of both stacks and queues, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends.

#### Properties of a Deque

1. **Double-ended**: Elements can be added or removed from both the front and the back of the deque.
  
2. **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, deques can dynamically resize themselves to accommodate new elements, allowing for flexible storage.

3. **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed randomly, just like arrays, which means accessing any element by its index is possible in constant time.

#### Operations

A deque typically supports the following operations:

1. **Push Front**: Add an element to the front of the deque.

2. **Push Back**: Add an element to the back of the deque.

3. **Pop Front**: Remove and return the element from the front of the deque.

4. **Pop Back**: Remove and return the element from the back of the deque.

5. **Front**: Access the element at the front of the deque without removing it.

6. **Back**: Access the element at the back of the deque without removing it.

7. **Size**: Get the number of elements currently in the deque.

8. **Empty**: Check if the deque is empty.

#### Implementation

In C++, you can implement a deque using the `std::deque` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's a basic example of how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

int main() {
    std::deque<int> myDeque;

    // Push elements to the back of the deque
    myDeque.push_back(10);
    myDeque.push_back(20);
    
    // Push elements to the front of the deque
    myDeque.push_front(5);
    myDeque.push_front(2);

    // Pop elements from the front and back of the deque
    myDeque.pop_front();
    myDeque.pop_back();

    // Access front and back elements
    std::cout << "Front: " << myDeque.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Back: " << myDeque.back() << std::endl;

    // Check size and if deque is empty
    std::cout << "Size: " << myDeque.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is Empty: " << (myDeque.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Use Cases

Deques are useful in situations where you need to efficiently add or remove elements from both ends of a collection. Some common use cases include:

- Implementing data structures like queues and stacks.
- Maintaining a sliding window in algorithms like sliding window maximum/minimum.
- Simulating a deck of cards in card games.
- Implementing certain algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) where you need to efficiently explore neighboring nodes.

Overall, deques are a powerful and versatile data structure that can be used in a wide range of applications due to their flexibility and efficiency in handling dynamic collections of elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): DEQueue (Double-Ended-Queue)

A Double-Ended Queue (DEQueue) is a data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and the rear ends. In C++, you can implement a DEQueue using various approaches, such as using doubly linked lists or arrays. Here's a simple implementation using a doubly linked list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node structure for the doubly linked list
template <typename T>
struct Node {
    T data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(const T& d) : data(d), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
};

// DEQueue class
template <typename T>
class DEQueue {
private:
    Node<T>* front;
    Node<T>* rear;
    int size;

public:
    DEQueue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr), size(0) {}

    // Function to check if the DEQueue is empty
    bool isEmpty() const {
        return size == 0;
    }

    // Function to get the size of the DEQueue
    int getSize() const {
        return size;
    }

    // Function to insert an element at the front of the DEQueue
    void insertFront(const T& value) {
        Node<T>* newNode = new Node<T>(value);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            newNode->next = front;
            front->prev = newNode;
            front = newNode;
        }
        size++;
    }

    // Function to insert an element at the rear of the DEQueue
    void insertRear(const T& value) {

This code provides a basic implementation of a DEQueue using a doubly linked list in C++. You can perform operations like insertion at both ends (`insertFront()` and `insertRear()`), removal from both ends (`removeFront()` and `removeRear()`), check if the DEQueue is empty (`isEmpty()`), get the size of the DEQueue (`getSize()`), and display the elements (`display()`).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Circular Queue (Theory)

A Circular Queue is a data structure that behaves like a normal queue (FIFO - First In, First Out), but with a fixed size. The main difference between a circular queue and a regular queue is that once the queue becomes full, instead of refusing to accept more elements, it starts overwriting the oldest elements in the queue.

Here's the basic theory behind implementing a Circular Queue in C++:

#### 1. Implementation

In C++, you can implement a Circular Queue using an array and two pointers, `front` and `rear`.

- `front`: points to the first element of the queue.
- `rear`: points to the last element of the queue.

Initially, both `front` and `rear` are set to `-1`.

#### 2. Operations

- **Enqueue (Insertion)**: To insert an element into the circular queue, you move the `rear` pointer to the next available position and insert the element there.

- **Dequeue (Deletion)**: To remove an element from the circular queue, you move the `front` pointer to the next available position and remove the element from there.

#### 3. Handling Circular Nature

Since the queue is circular, after reaching the end of the array, the `rear` pointer wraps around to the beginning, and similarly, after reaching the end, the `front` pointer wraps around to the beginning as well.

#### 4. Overflow and Underflow Conditions

- **Overflow**: Occurs when you try to insert an element into a full queue.
- **Underflow**: Occurs when you try to remove an element from an empty queue.

#### 5. Implementation Tips

- Always check for overflow and underflow conditions.
- Ensure to update the pointers correctly after every insertion and deletion operation.
- Handle the circular nature of the queue properly to avoid incorrect behavior.

#### Sample Code (Partial Implementation)

Here's a simplified implementation of a Circular Queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 5

class CircularQueue {
private:
    int arr[SIZE];
    int front, rear;

public:
    CircularQueue() {
        front = rear = -1;
    }

    // Function to check if queue is full
    bool isFull() {
        return (front == 0 && rear == SIZE - 1) || (rear == (front - 1) % (SIZE - 1));
    }

    // Function to check if queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == -1;
    }

    // Function to insert an element into the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full!" << endl;
            return;
        }
        if (front == -1)
            front = 0;
        rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE;
        arr[rear] = value;
        cout << value << " enqueued to queue." << endl;
    }

    // Function to remove an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        int value;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1;
        }
        value = arr[front];
        if (front == rear)
            front = rear = -1;
        else
            front = (front + 1) % SIZE;
        return value;
    }

    // Function to display the elements of the queue
    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return;
        }
        int i = front;
        do {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
            i = (i + 1) % SIZE;
        } while (i != (rear + 1) % SIZE);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularQueue q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);
    q.enqueue(40);
    q.enqueue(50);
    q.enqueue(60); // Queue is full
    cout << "Queue: ";
    q.display();
    cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Queue: ";
    q.display();
    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of a Circular Queue in C++. You can extend it further by adding additional functionalities like peek, clear, etc., as per your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue (Theory)

A queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It operates much like a line of people waiting for a service, where the person who arrives first is served first. In a queue, elements are added at the back (called enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called dequeue operation).

#### Properties of a Queue

1. **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: The element that is added first is the one to be removed first.

2. **Linear Data Structure**: A queue is a linear data structure, meaning its elements are arranged in a sequence.

3. **Dynamic Size**: A queue can dynamically grow or shrink to accommodate the elements being enqueued or dequeued.

4. **Two Primary Operations**:
   - **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
   - **Dequeue**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.

5. **Supports Peek Operation**: Peek operation retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

#### Key Operations of a Queue

1. **Enqueue (Push)**: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue (Pop)**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the front element of the queue.
4. **Rear**: Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of the queue.
5. **IsEmpty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
6. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

#### Implementation

Queues can be implemented using various underlying data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. Here's a basic implementation of a queue using a linked list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* next;
        Node(const T& item) : data(item), next(nullptr) {}
    };
    Node* frontPtr;
    Node* rearPtr;
public:
    Queue() : frontPtr(nullptr), rearPtr(nullptr) {}

    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty())
            dequeue();
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return frontPtr == nullptr;
    }

    void enqueue(const T& item) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(item);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            frontPtr = rearPtr = newNode;
        } else {
            rearPtr->next = newNode;
            rearPtr = newNode;
        }
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            Node* temp = frontPtr;
            if (frontPtr == rearPtr) {
                frontPtr = rearPtr = nullptr;
            } else {
                frontPtr = frontPtr->next;
            }
            delete temp;
        }
    }

    const T& front() const {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            return frontPtr->data;
        }
        throw std::runtime_error("Queue is empty");
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Front of the queue: " << q.front() << std::endl;

    q.dequeue();

    std::cout << "Front of the queue after dequeue: " << q.front() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Time Complexity

- Enqueue operation: O(1)
- Dequeue operation: O(1)
- Peek operation: O(1)
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.

This is a basic overview of the queue data structure, its properties, applications, and a simple implementation in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue Applications

Queues, a fundamental data structure in computer science, are commonly used to manage tasks, data, or events in a FIFO (First In, First Out) manner. Here are several common applications of queues in C++:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores nodes in a graph level by level. Queues are used to keep track of the nodes to be visited, ensuring that nodes at the current level are processed before moving to the next level.

2. **Simulation**: Queues are often used in simulations to model real-world scenarios. For example, in a bank simulation, the queue represents the line of customers waiting to be served.

3. **Task Scheduling**: Queues are used to schedule tasks or jobs in various applications such as operating systems, where tasks are executed in the order they were received.

4. **Printer Queue**: In a printing system, documents are printed in the order they were sent to the printer, making queues a natural choice for managing print jobs.

5. **CPU Scheduling**: Queues are used in CPU scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, where processes are queued and executed in a cyclic manner.

6. **Call Center Management**: Queues are used in call centers to manage incoming calls. Callers are placed in a queue and served by available agents in the order they called.

7. **Buffering**: Queues are used as buffers in networking and I/O operations. Incoming data is stored in a queue until it can be processed.

8. **Bounded Buffer Problem**: In producer-consumer scenarios, where producers produce data and consumers consume it, queues can be used as a bounded buffer to coordinate between producers and consumers.

9. **Caching**: Queues can be used in caching mechanisms, such as the LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction policy, where the least recently accessed item is evicted from the cache.

10. **Event Handling**: Queues are used in event-driven programming to handle events such as user inputs, network events, or timer expirations. Events are queued and processed in the order they occur.

In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a ready-to-use queue container in the `<queue>` header, making it easy to implement these applications. Additionally, C++ allows you to create your own queue data structure using arrays, linked lists, or other underlying data structures. Depending on the specific application and requirements, you can choose the most suitable implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue STL

### Operations Supported

1. **Push**: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
2. **Pop**: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front**: Accesses the element at the front of the queue.
4. **Back**: Accesses the element at the back of the queue.
5. **Empty**: Checks if the queue is empty.
6. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.

### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaring a queue of integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Pushing elements into the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Accessing the front and back elements
    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl; // Outputs: 10
    std::cout << "Back element: " << myQueue.back() << std::endl;   // Outputs: 30

    // Popping an element
    myQueue.pop();

    // Checking if the queue is empty and its size
    std::cout << "Is queue empty? " << (myQueue.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Outputs: No
    std::cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.size() << std::endl;                        // Outputs: 2

    return 0;
}
```

### Notes

- The `push` function adds elements to the back of the queue.
- The `pop` function removes the front element from the queue.
- Accessing front or back elements of an empty queue is undefined behavior, so it's always a good practice to check if the queue is empty before doing so.
- Queues are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to process elements in the order they were added, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search, etc.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue using 2 Stacks

Implementing a queue using two stacks is a common interview question that tests your understanding of data structures. Here's how you can do it in C++:

#### Key Concept

- A queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- A stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- By using two stacks, you can simulate the behavior of a queue.

#### Algorithm

- **Enqueue (push)**: Simply push the new element onto the first stack.
- **Dequeue (pop)**: If the second stack is empty, move all elements from the first stack to the second stack. Then pop the top element from the second stack.

#### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    stack<T> s1, s2;

public:
    void enqueue(T x) {
        // Push item into the first stack
        s1.push(x);
    }

    T dequeue() {
        if (s2.empty()) {
            // If second stack is empty, move all elements from first stack to second stack
            while (!s1.empty()) {
                s2.push(s1.top());
                s1.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // If second stack is still empty, queue is empty
        if (s2.empty()) {
            throw runtime_error("Queue is empty");
        }

        // Pop the element from second stack
        T topVal = s2.top();
        s2.pop();
        return topVal;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return s1.empty() && s2.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> q;

    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 2

    q.enqueue(4);
    
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Outputs 4

    // Uncommenting the next line will throw an exception since the queue is empty
    // cout << q.dequeue() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

1. **Enqueue Operation**:
    - Push the element onto `s1`.

2. **Dequeue Operation**:
    - If `s2` is empty, move all elements from `s1` to `s2`.
    - Pop the top element from `s2`.

3. **isEmpty Operation**:
    - Check if both `s1` and `s2` are empty.

#### Points to Note

- The `dequeue` operation may involve moving elements between stacks, which can be costly. However, each element is moved at most once between the stacks, resulting in an amortized time complexity of O(1) for both enqueue and dequeue operations.

This implementation efficiently simulates a queue using two stacks and is a good example of leveraging the properties of one data structure to implement another.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Queue: Weave

In the context of algorithms and data structures, particularly in C++, a "queue weave" can be understood as an operation that interlaces two queues into one. This process takes elements alternately from each queue and places them into a new queue. Below is a detailed explanation and a sample implementation of the "queue weave" using the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

### Explanation

Given two queues, \( q1 \) and \( q2 \), the goal is to create a new queue, \( q3 \), that contains elements from \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) in an alternating fashion. If one queue is longer than the other, the remaining elements from the longer queue will be appended to the end of \( q3 \).

### Steps to Implement the Queue Weave

1. Initialize an empty queue \( q3 \).
2. While both \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) are not empty, alternate taking elements from \( q1 \) and \( q2 \) and push them to \( q3 \).
3. If \( q1 \) still has elements after \( q2 \) is empty, append the remaining elements of \( q1 \) to \( q3 \).
4. If \( q2 \) still has elements after \( q1 \) is empty, append the remaining elements of \( q2 \) to \( q3 \).

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Function to weave two queues into one
std::queue<int> weaveQueues(std::queue<int>& q1, std::queue<int>& q2) {
    std::queue<int> q3; // Resultant queue

    // Weave the queues
    while (!q1.empty() && !q2.empty()) {
        q3.push(q1.front());
        q1.pop();
        q3.push(q2.front());
        q2.pop();
    }

    // If q1 still has elements, add them to q3
    while (!q1.empty()) {
        q3.push(q1.front());
        q1.pop();
    }

    // If q2 still has elements, add them to q3
    while (!q2.empty()) {
        q3.push(q2.front());
        q2.pop();
    }

    return q3;
}

int main() {
    // Example queues
    std::queue<int> q1;
    std::queue<int> q2;

    // Fill q1 with some elements
    q1.push(1);
    q1.push(3);
    q1.push(5);

    // Fill q2 with some elements
    q2.push(2);
    q2.push(4);
    q2.push(6);
    q2.push(8);

    // Weave the queues
    std::queue<int> q3 = weaveQueues(q1, q2);

    // Print the elements of the resultant queue
    std::cout << "Weaved Queue: ";
    while (!q3.empty()) {
        std::cout << q3.front() << " ";
        q3.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Header Files**: The code includes `<iostream>` for input-output operations and `<queue>` for using the queue data structure from STL.
2. **Function Definition**: The `weaveQueues` function takes two references to `std::queue<int>` and returns a new queue with elements weaved.
3. **While Loop**: The first while loop interlaces elements from both queues until one of them is empty.
4. **Remaining Elements**: The next two while loops handle the remaining elements of the non-empty queue.
5. **Main Function**: Initializes two example queues, fills them with elements, and calls the `weaveQueues` function. The result is then printed.

This implementation ensures that elements from both queues are interleaved correctly, and any remaining elements from the longer queue are appended to the result.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Reverse a queue

To reverse a queue in C++, you can use another auxiliary data structure, like a stack, to temporarily store the elements of the queue in reverse order. Here's how you can implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Function to reverse a queue
void reverseQueue(queue<int> &q) {
    stack<int> s;
    
    // Push elements of queue into stack
    while (!q.empty()) {
        s.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    
    // Pop elements from stack and push them back into the queue
    while (!s.empty()) {
        q.push(s.top());
        s.pop();
    }
}

// Function to print a queue
void printQueue(queue<int> q) {
    while (!q.empty()) {
        cout << q.front() << " ";
        q.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create a queue
    queue<int> q;
    
    // Push elements into the queue
    q.push(1);
    q.push(2);
    q.push(3);
    q.push(4);
    q.push(5);
    
    cout << "Original queue: ";
    printQueue(q);
    
    // Reverse the queue
    reverseQueue(q);
    
    cout << "Reversed queue: ";
    printQueue(q);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We use a stack to reverse the order of elements in the queue. We first push all elements of the queue into the stack.
2. Then, we pop elements from the stack and push them back into the queue. Since stacks follow a last in, first out (LIFO) order, this effectively reverses the order of elements.
3. Finally, we have helper functions `printQueue()` to print the elements of the queue before and after the reversal.

This code will output:

```bash
Original queue: 1 2 3 4 5 
Reversed queue: 5 4 3 2 1 
```

And the queue is successfully reversed.


### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Array representation of Queue

In C++, you can represent a queue using an array. Here's a simple implementation of a queue using an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define MAX_SIZE 100

class Queue {
private:
    int front, rear, size;
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];

public:
    Queue() {
        front = rear = -1;
        size = 0;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return size == 0;
    }

    bool isFull() {
        return size == MAX_SIZE;
    }

    void enqueue(int value) {
        if (isFull()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is full. Cannot enqueue more elements." << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        if (isEmpty())
            front = 0;
        rear = (rear + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        arr[rear] = value;
        size++;
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue." << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        front = (front + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        size--;
        if (isEmpty())
            front = rear = -1;
    }

    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. No front element." << std::endl;
            return -1; // Return some default value indicating queue is empty
        }
        return arr[front];
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;

    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);
    q.enqueue(40);

    std::cout << "Front element: " << q.peek() << std::endl;

    q.dequeue();
    q.dequeue();

    std::cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << q.peek() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we use an array to store the elements of the queue. The front and rear indices keep track of the positions of the first and last elements, respectively. We use the modulo operator to handle wrap-around when the end of the array is reached.

This implementation has a maximum size defined by `MAX_SIZE`. When the queue is full, attempting to enqueue additional elements will result in an error message. Similarly, attempting to dequeue from an empty queue will result in an error message.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Build A Queue With Two Stacks

Sure! In C++, you can implement a queue using two stacks. One stack will be used for enqueue operations (pushing elements) and the other for dequeue operations (popping elements). Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class QueueWithTwoStacks {
private:
    stack<int> inbox;   // Stack for enqueue operations
    stack<int> outbox;  // Stack for dequeue operations

public:
    // Add an element to the back of the queue
    void enqueue(int element) {
        inbox.push(element);
    }

    // Remove the front element of the queue and return it
    int dequeue() {
        if (outbox.empty()) {
            // If outbox is empty, transfer elements from inbox
            while (!inbox.empty()) {
                outbox.push(inbox.top());
                inbox.pop();
            }
        }
        
        if (outbox.empty()) {
            // Queue is empty
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // Or throw an exception
        }

        int frontElement = outbox.top();
        outbox.pop();
        return frontElement;
    }

    // Check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return inbox.empty() && outbox.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    QueueWithTwoStacks q;

    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 2

    q.enqueue(4);
    q.enqueue(5);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 4
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 5

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print "Queue is empty!" and -1

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation should give you a basic understanding of how to build a queue using two stacks in C++. The `enqueue` operation is straightforward as it just pushes elements onto one stack (`inbox`). The `dequeue` operation is a bit more complex; if the `outbox` stack is empty, it transfers elements from `inbox` to `outbox` first, and then pops the top element from `outbox` to simulate a dequeue operation. This way, the elements are dequeued in the same order as they were enqueued.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Concept of Imitating a Queue using 2 Stacks

Imitating a queue using two stacks is a classic problem in computer science and is often used to demonstrate how different data structures can be combined to achieve certain functionalities. In this case, we're trying to simulate the behavior of a queue (FIFO - First In, First Out) using two stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out).

Here's how you can implement this concept in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class QueueWithStacks {
private:
    stack<T> inbox;    // For enqueue operation
    stack<T> outbox;   // For dequeue operation

public:
    // Add an element to the back of the queue
    void enqueue(const T& element) {
        inbox.push(element);
    }

    // Remove and return the front element of the queue
    T dequeue() {
        if (outbox.empty()) {
            // If the outbox is empty, transfer elements from inbox to outbox
            while (!inbox.empty()) {
                outbox.push(inbox.top());
                inbox.pop();
            }
        }

        if (outbox.empty()) {
            // If both stacks are empty, the queue is empty
            cerr << "Error: Queue is empty!" << endl;
            exit(1); // Or throw an exception
        }

        T frontElement = outbox.top();
        outbox.pop();
        return frontElement;
    }

    // Check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() const {
        return inbox.empty() && outbox.empty();
    }

    // Get the number of elements in the queue
    size_t size() const {
        return inbox.size() + outbox.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    QueueWithStacks<int> q;

    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << endl;

    q.enqueue(40);

    cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- We have two stacks: `inbox` and `outbox`.
- For `enqueue` operation, we simply push elements onto the `inbox`.
- For `dequeue` operation, if `outbox` is empty, we transfer all elements from `inbox` to `outbox`, effectively reversing their order. This ensures that the oldest element is at the top of `outbox`, mimicking the behavior of a queue. Then, we pop from `outbox` to retrieve the front element.
- The `isEmpty` and `size` functions provide the corresponding functionalities to check if the queue is empty and get its size.

This implementation provides the same time complexities as a regular queue for enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, and size operations, all O(1) amortized time complexity.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Constructor and Destructor of Queue Class

Sure, I can provide you with a basic implementation of a queue class in C++ including its constructor and destructor. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* next;
        Node(T value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
    };

    Node* frontPtr;
    Node* rearPtr;

public:
    Queue() : frontPtr(nullptr), rearPtr(nullptr) {}

    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty()) {
            dequeue();
        }
    }

    void enqueue(const T& value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            frontPtr = rearPtr = newNode;
        } else {
            rearPtr->next = newNode;
            rearPtr = newNode;
        }
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = frontPtr;
        frontPtr = frontPtr->next;
        delete temp;
        if (frontPtr == nullptr) {
            rearPtr = nullptr;
        }
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return frontPtr == nullptr;
    }

    const T& front() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. No front element.\n";
            // Return a default value or throw an exception as desired
        }
        return frontPtr->data;
    }

    const T& rear() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. No rear element.\n";
            // Return a default value or throw an exception as desired
        }
        return rearPtr->data;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> myQueue;
    myQueue.enqueue(10);
    myQueue.enqueue(20);
    myQueue.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Front of the queue: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Rear of the queue: " << myQueue.rear() << std::endl;

    myQueue.dequeue();

    std::cout << "Front of the queue after dequeue: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `Queue` class uses a linked list to implement the queue.
- The constructor initializes both `frontPtr` and `rearPtr` to `nullptr`.
- The destructor deallocates all memory allocated for the nodes in the queue.
- `enqueue()` adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- `dequeue()` removes an element from the front of the queue.
- `front()` returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- `rear()` returns the element at the rear of the queue without removing it.
- `isEmpty()` checks whether the queue is empty or not.

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might need to add error handling, additional functionality, or optimize certain operations for efficiency.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Creating a Queue From Stacks

Creating a queue from stacks is a classic problem in computer science. You can implement a queue using two stacks. One stack will act as the input stack, where you enqueue elements, and the other stack will act as the output stack, where you dequeue elements.

Here's a basic implementation of a queue using two stacks in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

template <typename T>
class QueueFromStacks {
private:
    std::stack<T> inputStack;
    std::stack<T> outputStack;

public:
    // Enqueue operation
    void enqueue(const T& value) {
        inputStack.push(value);
    }

    // Dequeue operation
    T dequeue() {
        if (outputStack.empty()) {
            // If output stack is empty, transfer elements from input stack
            while (!inputStack.empty()) {
                outputStack.push(inputStack.top());
                inputStack.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // If output stack is still empty, queue is empty
        if (outputStack.empty()) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Queue is empty");
        }

        T front = outputStack.top();
        outputStack.pop();
        return front;
    }

    // Check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() const {
        return inputStack.empty() && outputStack.empty();
    }

    // Get the size of the queue
    size_t size() const {
        return inputStack.size() + outputStack.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    QueueFromStacks<int> myQueue;

    // Enqueue some elements
    myQueue.enqueue(10);
    myQueue.enqueue(20);
    myQueue.enqueue(30);

    // Dequeue and print elements
    std::cout << "Dequeued: " << myQueue.dequeue() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Dequeued: " << myQueue.dequeue() << std::endl;

    // Enqueue more elements
    myQueue.enqueue(40);
    myQueue.enqueue(50);

    // Dequeue and print remaining elements
    while (!myQueue.isEmpty()) {
        std::cout << "Dequeued: " << myQueue.dequeue() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We use two stacks, `inputStack` and `outputStack`, to simulate the queue operations.
- The `enqueue` operation simply pushes elements onto the `inputStack`.
- The `dequeue` operation pops elements from the `outputStack`. If the `outputStack` is empty, we transfer elements from the `inputStack` to the `outputStack` first.
- The `isEmpty` and `size` methods provide information about the state of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Drawback of Queue using Array

One drawback of implementing a queue using an array in C++ is the fixed size limitation. When you allocate an array for the queue, you have to specify its maximum size. This fixed size can lead to inefficiencies or errors in certain situations:

1. **Fixed Capacity**: Arrays have a fixed capacity, meaning you must allocate a certain amount of memory upfront. If the queue reaches its maximum capacity and you try to enqueue more elements, you'll encounter overflow, which can lead to data loss or program termination.

2. **Memory Waste**: If you allocate a large array to accommodate potential future growth of the queue, but the queue rarely reaches that size, you're wasting memory. This is inefficient, especially if memory is limited or expensive.

3. **Dynamic Behavior**: Queues often need to grow and shrink dynamically based on the number of elements they contain. With an array-based implementation, resizing the array dynamically (e.g., using `realloc` in C++) can be complex and inefficient.

4. **Fragmentation**: If you frequently enqueue and dequeue elements from the queue, the array might become fragmented over time, with unused spaces scattered throughout the array. This fragmentation can lead to wasted memory and reduced performance.

To overcome these limitations, you might consider using dynamic memory allocation (e.g., linked list-based implementation) or a circular buffer approach, which allows the queue to wrap around to the beginning of the array when it reaches the end, effectively reusing space. Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of time complexity, memory usage, and ease of implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Drawbacks of Implementing a Queue using Normal Array

Implementing a queue using a normal array in C++ has some drawbacks, primarily related to efficiency and flexibility:

1. **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size, meaning you have to preallocate memory for a certain number of elements. If the queue reaches its maximum capacity, adding more elements becomes problematic. You'd need to resize the array, which involves allocating a new array, copying elements, and deallocating the old array, resulting in a time-consuming operation.

2. **Dynamic Memory Management Overhead**: Resizing the array dynamically involves dynamic memory management, which can lead to fragmentation and overhead. It can also introduce issues like memory leaks or dangling pointers if not managed properly.

3. **Inefficient Dequeue Operation**: Removing an element from the front of the queue (dequeuing) requires shifting all the other elements to the front, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This operation can be inefficient, especially for large queues.

4. **Wasted Space**: If you preallocate a large array to accommodate potential growth, but the queue remains small, you'll waste memory.

5. **Insertion Overhead**: While inserting an element at the end of the queue (enqueueing) is efficient (O(1)), if the array needs resizing, it can lead to occasional performance overhead.

6. **Cache Inefficiency**: Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, so if the array size is large and the queue only occupies a small portion of it, cache efficiency decreases because of potential cache misses.

7. **Not Suitable for Real-time Systems**: In real-time systems where predictable performance is crucial, the dynamic resizing of arrays can introduce unpredictable delays, making them unsuitable.

To overcome these drawbacks, you might consider using other data structures like linked lists or dynamic arrays (vectors in C++) which can dynamically resize without much overhead, or circular buffers which can efficiently manage space and avoid shifting elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Dry run Circular Queue operations using the algorithm

Sure! Let's go through a dry run of Circular Queue operations using C++.

A Circular Queue is a data structure that operates in a similar way to a regular queue, but with a fixed size. When elements are dequeued, the space they occupied becomes available for further enqueuing.

Here's a simple implementation of a Circular Queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 5

class CircularQueue {
private:
    int items[SIZE], front, rear;

public:
    CircularQueue() {
        front = -1;
        rear = -1;
    }

    // Check if the queue is full
    bool isFull() {
        if ((front == 0 && rear == SIZE - 1) || (front == rear + 1))
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        if (front == -1)
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Add an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int element) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full" << endl;
        } else {
            if (front == -1)
                front = 0;
            rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE;
            items[rear] = element;
            cout << "Inserted " << element << endl;
        }
    }

    // Remove an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        int element;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty" << endl;
            return -1;
        } else {
            element = items[front];
            if (front == rear) {
                front = -1;
                rear = -1;
            } else {
                front = (front + 1) % SIZE;
            }
            return element;
        }
    }

    // Display the queue elements
    void display() {
        int i;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty" << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Front -> " << front << endl;
            cout << "Items -> ";
            for (i = front; i != rear; i = (i + 1) % SIZE)
                cout << items[i] << " ";
            cout << items[i];
            cout << endl;
            cout << "Rear -> " << rear << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularQueue q;

    // Inserting elements into Circular Queue
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);
    q.enqueue(4);
    q.enqueue(5);

    // Displaying elements present in Circular Queue 
    q.display();

    // Deleting elements from Circular Queue
    cout << "Deleted element = " << q.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Deleted element = " << q.dequeue() << endl;

    q.display();

    q.enqueue(6);
    q.enqueue(7);

    q.display();

    // Inserting another element will make queue full
    q.enqueue(8);

    return 0;
}
```

Let's run through this code step by step:

1. We start with an empty Circular Queue. `front` and `rear` are initialized to -1 to indicate an empty queue.
2. We enqueue elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the queue. Since the queue is not full, we add elements accordingly.
3. We display the elements in the queue. The `front` points to the first element and the `rear` points to the last element.
4. We dequeue two elements. This removes the elements from the queue. We display the updated queue after each dequeue operation.
5. We enqueue elements 6 and 7 into the queue. Since the queue is circular, it wraps around to the beginning when reaching the end.
6. We try to enqueue another element (8), but the queue is full, so we cannot insert it.

This is a basic dry run of Circular Queue operations using C++. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Dynamic Queue

A dynamic queue in C++ is a queue data structure that dynamically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed. Unlike a static queue, which has a fixed size, a dynamic queue can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate the number of elements it holds. This is achieved using dynamic memory allocation, typically with pointers.

Here's a basic implementation of a dynamic queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for each element in the queue
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class DynamicQueue {
private:
    Node* front; // Points to the front of the queue
    Node* rear;  // Points to the rear of the queue

public:
    DynamicQueue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }

    // Function to enqueue (insert) an element into the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node;
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->next = nullptr;

        // If the queue is empty, set both front and rear to the new node
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, add the new node to the rear and update rear
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to dequeue (remove) an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue." << endl;
            return -1; // Return some default value indicating failure
        }

        int value = front->data;
        Node* temp = front;

        // Move front to the next node
        front = front->next;

        // If after dequeue the queue becomes empty, update rear as well
        if (front == nullptr) {
            rear = nullptr;
        }

        delete temp; // Free memory of the dequeued node
        return value;
    }

    // Function to display the elements of the queue
    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return;
        }

        cout << "Queue elements: ";
        Node* temp = front;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Destructor to free memory allocated for nodes
    ~DynamicQueue() {
        while (!isEmpty()) {
            dequeue();
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    DynamicQueue queue;

    queue.enqueue(10);
    queue.enqueue(20);
    queue.enqueue(30);
    queue.display();

    cout << "Dequeue: " << queue.dequeue() << endl;
    cout << "Dequeue: " << queue.dequeue() << endl;

    queue.display();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `DynamicQueue` class with basic operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, and `display`. It dynamically allocates memory for nodes using `new` when elements are added and deallocates it using `delete` when elements are removed. The `display` function is used to print the elements of the queue. The destructor ensures that memory allocated for nodes is properly deallocated when the queue object is destroyed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Enqueue and Dequeue using Push1, Pop1, Push2 and Pop2

Sure, implementing a queue using two stacks (often called the two-stack method) involves using two stacks to simulate the behavior of a queue. Here's how you can implement enqueue and dequeue operations using two stacks in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class Queue {
private:
    stack<int> stack1;
    stack<int> stack2;

public:
    // Function to enqueue an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        // Push the element onto stack1
        stack1.push(value);
    }

    // Function to dequeue an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        // If both stacks are empty, the queue is empty
        if (stack1.empty() && stack2.empty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return -1; // Return some default value or throw an exception
        }

        // If stack2 is empty, transfer all elements from stack1 to stack2
        if (stack2.empty()) {
            while (!stack1.empty()) {
                stack2.push(stack1.top());
                stack1.pop();
            }
        }

        // Pop the top element from stack2 (which is the front of the queue)
        int front_element = stack2.top();
        stack2.pop();

        return front_element;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 2

    q.enqueue(4);
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 4

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: Queue is empty.

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, `stack1` is used to simulate the back of the queue (where elements are enqueued), and `stack2` is used to simulate the front of the queue (where elements are dequeued). When we need to dequeue an element, we first check if `stack2` is empty. If it is, we transfer all elements from `stack1` to `stack2`, effectively reversing the order of elements. Then we can pop the top element from `stack2`, which is the oldest element in the queue. If both stacks are empty when a dequeue operation is requested, it indicates that the queue is empty.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Enqueue in Linked List

To enqueue an element in a linked list using C++, you typically perform the following steps:

1. Create a new node with the given data.
2. If the linked list is empty, make the new node the head of the list.
3. Otherwise, traverse the list to the last node and make the last node point to the new node.

Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the class for the linked list
class LinkedList {
private:
    Node* head;

public:
    LinkedList() : head(nullptr) {}

    // Function to enqueue (insert at the end) an element
    void enqueue(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val); // Create a new node with the given data
        
        if (head == nullptr) { // If the list is empty
            head = newNode; // Make the new node the head of the list
        } else {
            Node* temp = head;
            while (temp->next != nullptr) { // Traverse to the last node
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            temp->next = newNode; // Make the last node point to the new node
        }
    }

    // Function to print the elements of the linked list
    void display() {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            std::cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    LinkedList list;

    // Enqueue some elements
    list.enqueue(1);
    list.enqueue(2);
    list.enqueue(3);
    list.enqueue(4);

    // Display the elements of the linked list
    std::cout << "Linked List: ";
    list.display();

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation defines a `Node` struct to represent each element in the linked list and a `LinkedList` class to manage the list. The `enqueue` function inserts elements at the end of the list, and the `display` function prints the elements of the list.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): EnQueue() and DeQueue() functions in Queue

Certainly! In C++, a queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: `EnQueue()` to add elements to the back of the queue, and `DeQueue()` to remove elements from the front of the queue.

Here's a simple implementation of these functions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a QueueNode
struct QueueNode {
    int data;
    QueueNode* next;
    QueueNode(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the structure of the Queue
class Queue {
private:
    QueueNode* front;
    QueueNode* rear;

public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // Function to add an element to the back of the queue
    void EnQueue(int val) {
        QueueNode* newNode = new QueueNode(val);
        
        // If the queue is empty
        if (rear == nullptr) {
            front = rear = newNode;
            return;
        }

        // Otherwise, add the new node to the rear and update the rear pointer
        rear->next = newNode;
        rear = newNode;
    }

    // Function to remove an element from the front of the queue
    void DeQueue() {
        // If the queue is empty
        if (front == nullptr) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
            return;
        }

        // Store the front node and move the front pointer to the next node
        QueueNode* temp = front;
        front = front->next;

        // If after dequeuing, the queue becomes empty, update the rear pointer to null
        if (front == nullptr) {
            rear = nullptr;
        }

        // Delete the dequeued node to avoid memory leaks
        delete temp;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue queue;
    
    // Enqueue some elements
    queue.EnQueue(10);
    queue.EnQueue(20);
    queue.EnQueue(30);

    // Dequeue an element
    queue.DeQueue();

    // Enqueue another element
    queue.EnQueue(40);

    // Dequeue remaining elements
    while (queue.front != nullptr) {
        cout << "Dequeued: " << queue.front->data << endl;
        queue.DeQueue();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple queue data structure using a linked list. The `EnQueue()` function adds elements to the rear of the queue, and the `DeQueue()` function removes elements from the front of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): EnQueue() and DeQueue() using Linked Representations

Certainly! In C++, you can implement a Queue data structure using linked representations. Here's a simple implementation of EnQueue() and DeQueue() operations:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node structure for a linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Queue class using linked list
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front; // Pointer to the front of the queue
    Node* rear;  // Pointer to the rear of the queue

public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // EnQueue operation to add an element to the rear of the queue
    void EnQueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        if (rear == nullptr) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
        std::cout << value << " enqueued to the queue.\n";
    }

    // DeQueue operation to remove an element from the front of the queue
    void DeQueue() {
        if (front == nullptr) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty, cannot dequeue.\n";
            return;
        }
        
        Node* temp = front;
        front = front->next;
        
        if (front == nullptr) {
            rear = nullptr; // Queue becomes empty
        }
        
        std::cout << temp->data << " dequeued from the queue.\n";
        delete temp;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue queue;

    // Enqueue some elements
    queue.EnQueue(10);
    queue.EnQueue(20);
    queue.EnQueue(30);

    // Dequeue elements
    queue.DeQueue();
    queue.DeQueue();
    queue.DeQueue();

    // Trying to dequeue from an empty queue
    queue.DeQueue();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` struct representing each element in the queue and a `Queue` class implementing EnQueue() and DeQueue() operations. The EnQueue() operation adds elements to the rear of the queue, while the DeQueue() operation removes elements from the front of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): EnQueue() in Circular Queue

Certainly! EnQueue operation in a circular queue is used to insert an element at the rear end of the queue. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 5

class CircularQueue {
private:
    int front, rear;
    int queue[SIZE];

public:
    CircularQueue() {
        front = rear = -1;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is full
    bool isFull() {
        if ((front == 0 && rear == SIZE - 1) || (rear == (front - 1) % (SIZE - 1))) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        if (front == -1) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Function to insert an element into the queue
    void enQueue(int value) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full. EnQueue operation failed." << endl;
            return;
        }

        if (front == -1) {
            front = rear = 0;
            queue[rear] = value;
        } else if (rear == SIZE - 1 && front != 0) {
            rear = 0;
            queue[rear] = value;
        } else {
            rear++;
            queue[rear] = value;
        }
        cout << value << " enQueued into the circular queue." << endl;
    }

    // Function to display the elements of the queue
    void displayQueue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return;
        }
        cout << "Elements in the circular queue are: ";
        if (rear >= front) {
            for (int i = front; i <= rear; i++)
                cout << queue[i] << " ";
        } else {
            for (int i = front; i < SIZE; i++)
                cout << queue[i] << " ";
            for (int i = 0; i <= rear; i++)
                cout << queue[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularQueue cq;

    // Inserting elements into Circular Queue
    cq.enQueue(10);
    cq.enQueue(20);
    cq.enQueue(30);
    cq.enQueue(40);
    cq.enQueue(50);
    cq.enQueue(60); // This will fail as the queue is full

    // Displaying the Circular Queue
    cq.displayQueue();

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements a circular queue of fixed size `SIZE`. The `enQueue` function inserts elements into the circular queue. It first checks whether the queue is full or not using the `isFull` function. If the queue is not full, it checks different conditions to correctly insert the element at the rear end of the queue, considering both forward and wrapping cases.

Finally, the `displayQueue` function is used to display the elements of the circular queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How Dequeue is performed using Front Variable

In C++, a deque (double-ended queue) is a data structure that allows insertion and deletion at both ends, i.e., the front and the back. You can implement a deque using various data structures, such as arrays or linked lists. If you're using a linked list implementation, you'd typically have nodes, each containing a value and pointers to the previous and next nodes.

Here's a basic example of how you could implement a deque using a linked list and a `front` variable to facilitate dequeue operations from the front:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define a Node structure for the linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
};

class Deque {
private:
    Node* front; // Pointer to the front of the deque
    Node* back;  // Pointer to the back of the deque

public:
    Deque() : front(nullptr), back(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert element at the front of the deque
    void push_front(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node{value, nullptr, front};
        if (front == nullptr) {
            front = back = newNode;
        } else {
            front->prev = newNode;
            front = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to remove and return element from the front of the deque
    int pop_front() {
        if (front == nullptr) {
            std::cerr << "Deque is empty!\n";
            return -1; // Or throw an exception
        }
        int value = front->data;
        Node* temp = front;
        if (front == back) {
            front = back = nullptr;
        } else {
            front = front->next;
            front->prev = nullptr;
        }
        delete temp;
        return value;
    }

    // Function to check if the deque is empty
    bool empty() const {
        return front == nullptr;
    }
};

int main() {
    Deque dq;

    dq.push_front(5);
    dq.push_front(10);
    dq.push_front(15);

    std::cout << "Deque elements: ";
    while (!dq.empty()) {
        std::cout << dq.pop_front() << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We have a `Node` struct to represent each element of the deque.
- The `Deque` class manages the deque operations.
- `push_front()` inserts an element at the front of the deque.
- `pop_front()` removes and returns the element from the front of the deque.
- The `front` variable points to the first element of the deque, facilitating dequeue operations from the front.
- The `back` variable could be used in a similar manner for operations at the back of the deque if needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How Enqueue is performed using Rear Variable

In a typical queue implementation in C++, when you enqueue an element, you're adding it to the back of the queue. This involves updating the "rear" variable to point to the new element if it's the first element, or simply moving the rear pointer one position forward if the queue already contains elements.

Here's a simple implementation of a queue using a linked list in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define a structure for the node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

// Define the Queue class
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front;
    Node* rear;

public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // Enqueue operation to add elements to the back of the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node;
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->next = nullptr;

        // If the queue is empty, update both front and rear
        if (rear == nullptr) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, update the rear pointer
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to display the queue
    void display() {
        if (front == nullptr) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty" << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = front;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            std::cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);
    q.display();
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` is a simple structure defining a node of the linked list.
- The `Queue` class maintains pointers to the front and rear of the queue.
- The `enqueue` function adds elements to the queue by creating a new node and updating the rear pointer accordingly.
- The `display` function is included to visualize the queue's contents.

In the `enqueue` function:

- If the queue is empty (rear is nullptr), the front and rear pointers are updated to point to the new node.
- If the queue is not empty, the new node is appended to the end of the queue by updating the rear pointer to point to it and then moving the rear pointer forward.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How Queue is Implemented using Linked List

Implementing a queue using a linked list in C++ is quite straightforward. In a linked list-based queue, you use a linked list to store the elements of the queue, and you maintain pointers to the front and rear of the queue to efficiently enqueue and dequeue elements. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node class for creating nodes of the linked list
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Queue class implemented using a linked list
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front; // Pointer to the front of the queue
    Node* rear;  // Pointer to the rear of the queue

public:
    // Constructor
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // Destructor
    ~Queue() {
        // Deallocate memory for all nodes in the queue
        while (front != nullptr) {
            Node* temp = front;
            front = front->next;
            delete temp;
        }
        rear = nullptr;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }

    // Function to enqueue an element into the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        // Create a new node with the given value
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);

        // If the queue is empty, set both front and rear to the new node
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, add the new node to the rear and update the rear pointer
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to dequeue an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
            return -1; // Assuming -1 is used as an error indicator
        } else {
            // Store the data of the front node and move front to the next node
            int data = front->data;
            Node* temp = front;
            front = front->next;
            delete temp;
            
            // If front becomes nullptr, set rear to nullptr as well
            if (front == nullptr) {
                rear = nullptr;
            }
            
            return data;
        }
    }

    // Function to peek at the front element of the queue without removing it
    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. Cannot peek.\n";
            return -1; // Assuming -1 is used as an error indicator
        } else {
            return front->data;
        }
    }
};

// Sample usage
int main() {
    Queue q;
    
    // Enqueue elements
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    // Dequeue and print elements
    std::cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Dequeued: " << q.dequeue() << std::endl;

    // Enqueue more elements
    q.enqueue(40);
    q.enqueue(50);

    // Peek at the front element
    std::cout << "Front element: " << q.peek() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a singly linked list. Each node holds the data and a pointer to the next node. The `Queue` class maintains pointers to the front and rear nodes of the queue. Enqueueing is done by adding a new node at the rear, and dequeueing is done by removing the node at the front.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How to add and remove from a Queue

Adding and removing elements from a queue in C++ is quite straightforward using the standard library's `queue` container, which is part of the `<queue>` header. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a queue of integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Adding elements to the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Removing elements from the queue
    std::cout << "Removing elements from the queue:" << std::endl;
    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << myQueue.front() << " ";
        myQueue.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `push(value)` is used to add elements to the back of the queue.
- `front()` returns the front element of the queue (the oldest element).
- `pop()` removes the front element from the queue.

Remember to include the necessary headers `<iostream>` for input and output and `<queue>` for the queue container. This example demonstrates a basic usage scenario, but you can use the `queue` container for any type of data, not just integers.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Immutable Stack and Queue

Creating immutable versions of stack and queue data structures in C++ requires some careful design. Here's a basic implementation of immutable stack and queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

template <typename T>
class ImmutableStack {
private:
    const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>> previous;
    const T value;
public:
    ImmutableStack() : previous(nullptr), value(T()) {}
    ImmutableStack(const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>>& prev, const T& val) : previous(prev), value(val) {}

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return !previous;
    }

    T top() const {
        return value;
    }

    std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>> pop() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Stack is empty");
        }
        return previous;
    }

    std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>> push(const T& val) const {
        return std::make_shared<const ImmutableStack<T>>(this->shared_from_this(), val);
    }
};

template <typename T>
class ImmutableQueue {
private:
    const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>> frontStack;
    const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>> rearStack;
public:
    ImmutableQueue() : frontStack(nullptr), rearStack(nullptr) {}
    ImmutableQueue(const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>>& front, const std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableStack<T>>& rear)
        : frontStack(front), rearStack(rear) {}

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return !frontStack && !rearStack;
    }

    T front() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Queue is empty");
        }
        if (frontStack) {
            return frontStack->top();
        } else {
            return rearStack->top();
        }
    }

    std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableQueue<T>> pop() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            throw std::out_of_range("Queue is empty");
        }
        if (frontStack) {
            return std::make_shared<const ImmutableQueue<T>>(frontStack->pop(), rearStack);
        } else {
            return std::make_shared<const ImmutableQueue<T>>(nullptr, rearStack->pop());
        }
    }

    std::shared_ptr<const ImmutableQueue<T>> push(const T& val) const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            return std::make_shared<const ImmutableQueue<T>>(
                std::make_shared<const ImmutableStack<T>>()->push(val), nullptr);
        } else {
            return std::make_shared<const ImmutableQueue<T>>(frontStack, rearStack->push(val));
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    auto queue = std::make_shared<const ImmutableQueue<int>>();
    auto queue1 = queue->push(1)->push(2)->push(3);
    auto front = queue1->front();
    std::cout << "Front element: " << front << std::endl;

    auto queue2 = queue1->pop();
    front = queue2->front();
    std::cout << "Front element after pop: " << front << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `ImmutableStack` is a simple immutable stack with methods `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `isEmpty`.
- `ImmutableQueue` is implemented using two stacks, where elements are enqueued to one stack and dequeued from another. This approach ensures that dequeue operations are performed in constant time.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and may not cover all edge cases or be the most efficient solution for all scenarios.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implement Queue using Front and Rear Variables

Certainly! Implementing a queue using front and rear variables in C++ is a fundamental exercise in understanding how queues work. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX_SIZE 100 // Maximum size of the queue

class Queue {
private:
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];
    int front, rear;

public:
    Queue() {
        front = -1;
        rear = -1;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return (front == -1 && rear == -1);
    }

    bool isFull() {
        return (rear + 1) % MAX_SIZE == front ? true : false;
    }

    void enqueue(int value) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full. Cannot enqueue." << endl;
            return;
        } else if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = 0;
        } else {
            rear = (rear + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
        arr[rear] = value;
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue." << endl;
            return;
        } else if (front == rear) {
            front = rear = -1;
        } else {
            front = (front + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
    }

    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. No front element." << endl;
            return -1; // Return some default value or throw an exception
        }
        return arr[front];
    }

    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return;
        }
        int i = front;
        while (i != rear) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
            i = (i + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
        cout << arr[rear] << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);
    q.enqueue(40);
    q.enqueue(50);

    cout << "Queue elements: ";
    q.display();

    cout << "Front element: " << q.peek() << endl;

    q.dequeue();
    cout << "Queue after dequeue: ";
    q.display();

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `front` and `rear` variables keep track of the front and rear of the queue, respectively.
- `isEmpty()` and `isFull()` functions are used to check if the queue is empty or full, respectively.
- `enqueue()` function adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- `dequeue()` function removes an element from the front of the queue.
- `peek()` function returns the front element without removing it.
- `display()` function displays all the elements of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implement Queue Using ONE stack

Implementing a queue using only one stack in C++ involves a clever manipulation of the stack operations. The idea is to simulate the behavior of a queue using just one stack. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class Queue {
private:
    stack<int> s1;

public:
    void enqueue(int x) {
        s1.push(x); // Push element to stack
    }

    int dequeue() {
        if (s1.empty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // Or throw an exception
        }

        int x = s1.top();
        s1.pop();

        if (s1.empty()) // If this was the last element, return
            return x;
        
        int item = dequeue(); // Recursively dequeue until the last element
        s1.push(x); // Push back elements after recursion
        
        return item;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return s1.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 2
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: Queue is empty!

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `enqueue()` operation simply pushes the element onto the stack.
- The `dequeue()` operation is a bit tricky. It recursively dequeues elements until the last element of the stack is reached. Then, it pops that last element and returns it. During the recursion, elements are popped and pushed back onto the stack, effectively reversing their order.
- `isEmpty()` checks if the stack is empty.

Keep in mind that this implementation has some limitations and may not be as efficient as using two stacks or other queue implementations, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. However, it demonstrates the concept of implementing a queue using one stack.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Circular Queue

Sure, here's a basic implementation of a circular queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#define MAX_SIZE 100

using namespace std;

class CircularQueue {
private:
    int front, rear;
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];
public:
    CircularQueue() {
        front = -1;
        rear = -1;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return (front == -1 && rear == -1);
    }

    bool isFull() {
        return ((rear + 1) % MAX_SIZE == front);
    }

    void enqueue(int val) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full." << endl;
            return;
        } else if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = 0;
        } else {
            rear = (rear + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
        arr[rear] = val;
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return;
        } else if (front == rear) {
            front = rear = -1;
        } else {
            front = (front + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
    }

    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return -1;
        }
        return arr[front];
    }

    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return;
        }
        cout << "Elements in the queue are: ";
        int i = front;
        while (i != rear) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
            i = (i + 1) % MAX_SIZE;
        }
        cout << arr[rear] << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularQueue q;
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);
    q.enqueue(4);
    q.display();
    q.dequeue();
    q.dequeue();
    q.display();
    q.enqueue(5);
    q.enqueue(6);
    q.display();
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation defines a class `CircularQueue` with methods for `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, `isFull`, `peek`, and `display`. It uses an array to store the elements of the queue, and it keeps track of the `front` and `rear` indices to implement the circular nature of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Double Ended Queue

Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a Double Ended Queue (Deque) in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for doubly linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int val) : data(val), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Deque {
private:
    Node* front;
    Node* rear;
    int size;
    
public:
    Deque() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr), size(0) {}
    
    // Check if deque is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return size == 0;
    }
    
    // Get the size of the deque
    int getSize() {
        return size;
    }
    
    // Insert element at the front of the deque
    void insertFront(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            newNode->next = front;
            front->prev = newNode;
            front = newNode;
        }
        size++;
    }
    
    // Insert element at the rear of the deque
    void insertRear(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            rear->next = newNode;
            newNode->prev = rear;
            rear = newNode;
        }
        size++;
    }
    
    // Remove element from the front of the deque
    void deleteFront() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Deque is empty\n";
        } else {
            Node* temp = front;
            if (front == rear) {
                front = rear = nullptr;
            } else {
                front = front->next;
                front->prev = nullptr;
            }
            delete temp;
            size--;
        }
    }
    
    // Remove element from the rear of the deque
    void deleteRear() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Deque is empty\n";
        } else {
            Node* temp = rear;
            if (front == rear) {
                front = rear = nullptr;
            } else {
                rear = rear->prev;
                rear->next = nullptr;
            }
            delete temp;
            size--;
        }
    }
    
    // Display the deque
    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Deque is empty\n";
            return;
        }
        Node* curr = front;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            cout << curr->data << " ";
            curr = curr->next;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Deque dq;
    
    dq.insertFront(1);
    dq.insertRear(2);
    dq.insertFront(3);
    dq.insertRear(4);
    
    cout << "Deque: ";
    dq.display(); // Output: Deque: 3 1 2 4
    
    dq.deleteFront();
    dq.deleteRear();
    
    cout << "Deque after deletion: ";
    dq.display(); // Output: Deque after deletion: 1 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a doubly linked list to represent the deque. It supports insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the deque and provides methods to check if the deque is empty and to get its size.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of FIFO Queue

Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Queue {
private:
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* next;
        Node(const T& data) : data(data), next(nullptr) {}
    };

    Node* frontPtr;
    Node* rearPtr;
    int size;

public:
    Queue() : frontPtr(nullptr), rearPtr(nullptr), size(0) {}

    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty()) {
            dequeue();
        }
    }

    void enqueue(const T& data) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(data);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            frontPtr = rearPtr = newNode;
        } else {
            rearPtr->next = newNode;
            rearPtr = newNode;
        }
        size++;
    }

    void dequeue() {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            Node* temp = frontPtr;
            frontPtr = frontPtr->next;
            delete temp;
            size--;
            if (isEmpty()) {
                rearPtr = nullptr;
            }
        } else {
            std::cerr << "Error: Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
        }
    }

    T front() const {
        if (!isEmpty()) {
            return frontPtr->data;
        } else {
            throw std::runtime_error("Error: Queue is empty. Cannot retrieve front element.");
        }
    }

    bool isEmpty() const {
        return size == 0;
    }

    int getSize() const {
        return size;
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue<int> myQueue;

    myQueue.enqueue(10);
    myQueue.enqueue(20);
    myQueue.enqueue(30);

    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.getSize() << std::endl;

    myQueue.dequeue();

    std::cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Queue size after dequeue: " << myQueue.getSize() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation defines a `Queue` class using a linked list. Each element in the queue is represented by a node containing the data and a pointer to the next node. The `enqueue()` function adds elements to the rear of the queue, while `dequeue()` removes elements from the front of the queue. The `front()` function returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Priority Queue

Sure, I can provide you with a simple implementation of a priority queue in C++ using a binary heap. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<T> heap;

    // Helper functions
    int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; }
    int left(int i) { return 2 * i + 1; }
    int right(int i) { return 2 * i + 2; }

    // Maintains heap property by moving the element up
    void heapifyUp(int i) {
        while (i > 0 && heap[parent(i)] < heap[i]) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[parent(i)]);
            i = parent(i);
        }
    }

    // Maintains heap property by moving the element down
    void heapifyDown(int i) {
        int maxIndex = i;
        int l = left(i);
        int r = right(i);

        if (l < heap.size() && heap[l] > heap[maxIndex])
            maxIndex = l;
        if (r < heap.size() && heap[r] > heap[maxIndex])
            maxIndex = r;

        if (i != maxIndex) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[maxIndex]);
            heapifyDown(maxIndex);
        }
    }

public:
    // Insert element into the priority queue
    void insert(T element) {
        heap.push_back(element);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    // Remove the highest priority element from the queue
    T extractMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }

        T max = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap.back();
        heap.pop_back();
        heapifyDown(0);

        return max;
    }

    // Get the highest priority element without removing it
    T getMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }
        return heap[0];
    }

    // Check if the priority queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return heap.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.insert(5);
    pq.insert(10);
    pq.insert(3);
    pq.insert(7);

    // Print and remove elements from the priority queue
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        cout << pq.extractMax() << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a max-heap to implement the priority queue. The `insert` function inserts an element into the priority queue, the `extractMax` function removes and returns the highest priority element, the `getMax` function returns the highest priority element without removing it, and the `isEmpty` function checks if the priority queue is empty.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Queue using Linked List

Certainly! Here's a basic implementation of a Queue using a linked list in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node class to represent each element of the linked list
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Queue class implementing the Queue using linked list
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front; // Pointer to the front of the queue
    Node* rear;  // Pointer to the rear of the queue
public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }

    // Function to enqueue an element to the rear of the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to dequeue an element from the front of the queue
    void dequeue() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
        } else {
            Node* temp = front;
            front = front->next;
            delete temp;
            if (front == nullptr) {
                rear = nullptr; // Reset rear when the last element is dequeued
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to get the front element of the queue
    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty. No front element.\n";
            return -1; // Returning -1 indicating an invalid value
        }
        return front->data;
    }

    // Function to display the elements of the queue
    void display() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty.\n";
        } else {
            Node* current = front;
            std::cout << "Queue elements: ";
            while (current != nullptr) {
                std::cout << current->data << " ";
                current = current->next;
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Destructor to free memory
    ~Queue() {
        while (!isEmpty()) {
            dequeue();
        }
    }
};

// Main function to test the implementation
int main() {
    Queue queue;

    queue.enqueue(10);
    queue.enqueue(20);
    queue.enqueue(30);
    queue.enqueue(40);

    queue.display(); // Output should be: 10 20 30 40

    std::cout << "Front element: " << queue.peek() << std::endl; // Output should be: 10

    queue.dequeue();
    queue.dequeue();

    queue.display(); // Output should be: 30 40

    std::cout << "Front element: " << queue.peek() << std::endl; // Output should be: 30

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of a queue using a linked list in C++. The `Queue` class provides methods for enqueueing, dequeueing, checking if the queue is empty, peeking at the front element, and displaying the elements of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementing Linked Representation of Queue

Certainly! Implementing a queue using a linked representation involves creating a linked list where each node represents an element in the queue. Here's a basic implementation of a queue using a linked list in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the Queue class
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front;
    Node* rear;
    
public:
    Queue() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}
    
    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }
    
    // Function to enqueue an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        
        // If queue is empty, both front and rear point to the new node
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            // Else, append the new node to the rear of the queue
            rear->next = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        }
        
        std::cout << value << " enqueued to queue." << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Function to dequeue an element from the queue
    void dequeue() {
        // Check if queue is empty
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue." << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        
        // Store the node to be dequeued
        Node* temp = front;
        
        // Move front pointer to the next node
        front = front->next;
        
        // If front becomes null, then set rear to null as well
        if (front == nullptr) {
            rear = nullptr;
        }
        
        std::cout << temp->data << " dequeued from queue." << std::endl;
        
        // Free memory
        delete temp;
    }
    
    // Function to display the elements of the queue
    void display() {
        // Check if queue is empty
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cout << "Queue is empty." << std::endl;
            return;
        }
        
        std::cout << "Elements in the queue: ";
        Node* current = front;
        
        // Traverse the queue and print elements
        while (current != nullptr) {
            std::cout << current->data << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Function to get the front element of the queue
    int getFront() {
        // Check if queue is empty
        if (isEmpty()) {
            std::cerr << "Queue is empty." << std::endl;
            return -1; // Error code or throw exception
        }
        return front->data;
    }
};

// Main function for testing the Queue implementation
int main() {
    Queue queue;
    
    queue.enqueue(10);
    queue.enqueue(20);
    queue.enqueue(30);
    
    queue.display(); // Output: Elements in the queue: 10 20 30
    
    std::cout << "Front element: " << queue.getFront() << std::endl; // Output: Front element: 10
    
    queue.dequeue();
    
    queue.display(); // Output: Elements in the queue: 20 30
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a basic implementation of a queue using a linked list. It provides functions to enqueue, dequeue, display the elements of the queue, and get the front element of the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementing QEUEUE using STACK Data Structure

Implementing a queue using stacks in C++ can be done by using two stacks. One stack is used for enqueue operations, and the other stack is used for dequeue operations. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class QueueUsingStack {
private:
    stack<int> enqueueStack;
    stack<int> dequeueStack;

public:
    void enqueue(int x) {
        // Simply push the element onto the enqueue stack
        enqueueStack.push(x);
    }

    int dequeue() {
        // Check if dequeue stack is empty
        if (dequeueStack.empty()) {
            // Transfer all elements from enqueue stack to dequeue stack
            while (!enqueueStack.empty()) {
                dequeueStack.push(enqueueStack.top());
                enqueueStack.pop();
            }
        }

        // If dequeue stack is still empty, the queue is empty
        if (dequeueStack.empty()) {
            cerr << "Error: Queue is empty." << endl;
            return -1; // Return a sentinel value indicating error
        }

        // Pop from dequeue stack to perform dequeue operation
        int front = dequeueStack.top();
        dequeueStack.pop();
        return front;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        // Queue is empty if both stacks are empty
        return enqueueStack.empty() && dequeueStack.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    QueueUsingStack q;

    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 2

    q.enqueue(4);
    q.enqueue(5);

    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 4
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 5

    cout << (q.isEmpty() ? "Queue is empty" : "Queue is not empty") << endl; // Should print "Queue is empty"

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `enqueueStack` is used for enqueue operations. When a dequeue operation is requested, elements are transferred from the `enqueueStack` to the `dequeueStack` (if it's empty). Then, the top element of the `dequeueStack` is popped to perform the dequeue operation.

This implementation ensures that enqueue and dequeue operations take \(O(1)\) amortized time complexity, with \(O(n)\) time complexity for transferring elements between stacks when needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt Min Priority Queue

In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) to work with a min priority queue. The `std::priority_queue` container in C++ STL is by default a max heap, but you can make it behave like a min heap by providing a custom comparator. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of min priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;

    // Inserting elements into the min heap
    minHeap.push(5);
    minHeap.push(2);
    minHeap.push(8);
    minHeap.push(1);
    minHeap.push(3);

    // Accessing the top element of the min heap
    std::cout << "Top element of min heap: " << minHeap.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element from the min heap
    minHeap.pop();
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << minHeap.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the code above:

- `std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>>` declares a min priority queue of integers. The third template argument `std::greater<int>` specifies the comparison function, making it a min heap. `std::greater<int>` is a functor that returns true if the first argument is greater than the second, thus making the priority queue behave like a min heap.

- `push()` is used to insert elements into the priority queue.

- `top()` returns a reference to the top (minimum) element of the priority queue.

- `pop()` removes the top element from the priority queue.

This is a simple example of using a min priority queue in C++ using the STL. You can customize it based on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt Priority Queue

In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue efficiently. Priority queues are a type of container adapters, which are specifically designed to operate in a way that the elements with the highest priority are served before elements with lower priority. Here's a brief overview of how to use the inbuilt priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority element) of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element from the priority queue
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the top element after removal
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    std::cout << "Is priority queue empty? " << (pq.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    // Size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We include the `<queue>` header, which provides the priority queue functionality.
- We create a priority queue `pq` of integers using `std::priority_queue<int>`.
- We can push elements into the priority queue using the `push()` method.
- To access the top element (the element with the highest priority), we use the `top()` method.
- To remove the top element, we use the `pop()` method.
- We can check if the priority queue is empty using the `empty()` method.
- The `size()` method returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

The elements are arranged in the priority queue in such a way that the element with the highest priority (maximum value by default for integers) is at the top. You can also define your custom comparison function to change the priority order based on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt queue

In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides a versatile set of containers and algorithms, including queues, which are implemented as part of the `<queue>` header. The `queue` container is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, meaning that elements are inserted at the back and removed from the front. Here's a basic example of how to use the inbuilt `queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a queue of integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Inserting elements into the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    // Accessing the front element
    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;

    // Accessing the back element
    std::cout << "Back element: " << myQueue.back() << std::endl;

    // Removing elements from the queue
    myQueue.pop();

    // Displaying the size of the queue
    std::cout << "Size of the queue: " << myQueue.size() << std::endl;

    // Checking if the queue is empty
    if (myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Queue is empty." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Queue is not empty." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates basic operations with a queue:

1. `push`: Inserts an element at the back of the queue.
2. `front`: Accesses the element at the front of the queue.
3. `back`: Accesses the element at the back of the queue.
4. `pop`: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
5. `size`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
6. `empty`: Checks if the queue is empty.

Remember to include the `<queue>` header at the beginning of your code to use the `queue` container.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): InsertFront() and InsertRear() in DEQueue

In C++, you can implement a double-ended queue (deque) and its `InsertFront()` and `InsertRear()` operations using a doubly linked list. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node structure for the doubly linked list
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node* prev;
    
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr), prev(nullptr) {}
};

// Double-ended queue class
class Deque {
private:
    Node* front;
    Node* rear;
    
public:
    Deque() : front(nullptr), rear(nullptr) {}
    
    // Function to insert an element at the front of the deque
    void InsertFront(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            newNode->next = front;
            front->prev = newNode;
            front = newNode;
        }
    }
    
    // Function to insert an element at the rear of the deque
    void InsertRear(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = rear = newNode;
        } else {
            rear->next = newNode;
            newNode->prev = rear;
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }
    
    // Function to check if the deque is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return front == nullptr;
    }
    
    // Function to display the deque from front to rear
    void display() {
        Node* temp = front;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            std::cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Deque dq;
    
    dq.InsertFront(10);
    dq.InsertFront(20);
    dq.InsertRear(30);
    dq.InsertRear(40);
    
    std::cout << "Deque: ";
    dq.display(); // Output: Deque: 20 10 30 40
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `Node` structure to represent each element in the doubly linked list.
- The `Deque` class contains two pointers: `front` points to the first node, and `rear` points to the last node.
- `InsertFront()` inserts a new node at the beginning of the deque.
- `InsertRear()` inserts a new node at the end of the deque.
- `isEmpty()` checks if the deque is empty.
- `display()` traverses the deque from front to rear and prints its elements.

You can extend this implementation by adding other operations such as deleting elements from the front and rear, accessing elements, and so on.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Interleave two halves of a queue

To interleave two halves of a queue in C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the queue into two halves.
2. Interleave the elements of the two halves.
3. Merge the interleaved halves back into the original queue.

Here's a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Function to interleave two halves of a queue
void interleave(queue<int>& q) {
    // Step 1: Split the queue into two halves
    int size = q.size();
    int half_size = size / 2;

    queue<int> first_half, second_half;
    for (int i = 0; i < half_size; ++i) {
        first_half.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    while (!q.empty()) {
        second_half.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }

    // Step 2: Interleave the elements of the two halves
    while (!first_half.empty()) {
        q.push(second_half.front());
        second_half.pop();
        q.push(first_half.front());
        first_half.pop();
    }

    // Step 3: Merge the interleaved halves back into the original queue
    while (!second_half.empty()) {
        q.push(second_half.front());
        second_half.pop();
    }
}

// Function to print the elements of a queue
void printQueue(queue<int> q) {
    while (!q.empty()) {
        cout << q.front() << " ";
        q.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    queue<int> q;
    // Push elements into the queue
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
        q.push(i);
    }

    cout << "Original Queue: ";
    printQueue(q);

    interleave(q);

    cout << "Interleaved Queue: ";
    printQueue(q);

    return 0;
}
```

This code first splits the queue into two halves, then interleave the elements of the two halves, and finally merges the interleaved halves back into the original queue. You can test it by running the `main` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Linked Representation of Queue

Sure, here's a basic implementation of a queue using linked representation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node class to represent individual elements in the queue
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    // Constructor to initialize a node with given data
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

// Queue class
class Queue {
private:
    Node* front; // Pointer to the front of the queue
    Node* rear;  // Pointer to the rear of the queue

public:
    // Constructor to initialize an empty queue
    Queue() {
        front = nullptr;
        rear = nullptr;
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return (front == nullptr);
    }

    // Function to enqueue an element into the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        // Create a new node with the given value
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);

        // If the queue is empty, set both front and rear to the new node
        if (isEmpty()) {
            front = newNode;
            rear = newNode;
        } else {
            // Otherwise, link the current rear node to the new node
            rear->next = newNode;
            // Update the rear pointer to the new node
            rear = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Function to dequeue an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        // If the queue is empty, return -1 (assuming -1 is not a valid queue element)
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue.\n";
            return -1;
        } else {
            // Store the data of the front node
            int data = front->data;
            // Move the front pointer to the next node
            Node* temp = front;
            front = front->next;
            // If the front becomes nullptr (queue becomes empty), also update rear to nullptr
            if (front == nullptr) {
                rear = nullptr;
            }
            // Delete the previous front node
            delete temp;
            // Return the data of the dequeued node
            return data;
        }
    }

    // Function to return the front element of the queue without dequeueing it
    int peek() {
        // If the queue is empty, return -1
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot peek.\n";
            return -1;
        } else {
            // Return the data of the front node
            return front->data;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;

    // Enqueue elements into the queue
    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    // Print the front element of the queue
    cout << "Front element: " << q.peek() << endl;

    // Dequeue an element
    cout << "Dequeued element: " << q.dequeue() << endl;

    // Print the front element again
    cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << q.peek() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a singly linked list to represent the queue. Each node contains an integer value (`data`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`). The `Queue` class manages the front and rear pointers of the queue and provides methods for enqueueing, dequeueing, and peeking elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Manipulating Queues

Certainly! Manipulating queues in C++ is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks. Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the back and removed from the front. C++ provides a standard library `queue` container adapter that makes it easy to work with queues.

Here's a basic overview of how to manipulate queues in C++:

#### Creating a Queue

You can create a queue in C++ using the `std::queue` container adapter provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). You need to include the `<queue>` header to use it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::queue<int> myQueue;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Adding Elements to the Queue

You can add elements to the back of the queue using the `push()` method.

```cpp
myQueue.push(10);
myQueue.push(20);
myQueue.push(30);
```

#### Removing Elements from the Queue

You can remove elements from the front of the queue using the `pop()` method.

```cpp
myQueue.pop();
```

#### Accessing the Front Element

You can access the front element of the queue using the `front()` method.

```cpp
std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;
```

#### Checking if the Queue is Empty

You can check if the queue is empty using the `empty()` method.

```cpp
if (!myQueue.empty()) {
    // Queue is not empty
}
```

#### Getting the Size of the Queue

You can get the size of the queue using the `size()` method.

```cpp
std::cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.size() << std::endl;
```

#### Iterating Over the Queue

You can't directly iterate over the queue like a standard container, but you can copy it to another container and then iterate over it.

```cpp
std::queue<int> tempQueue = myQueue;
while (!tempQueue.empty()) {
    std::cout << tempQueue.front() << " ";
    tempQueue.pop();
}
std::cout << std::endl;
```

#### Clearing the Queue

You can clear the queue using the `queue.swap(queue())` trick.

```cpp
std::queue<int>().swap(myQueue);
```

#### Full Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);

    std::cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << std::endl;

    myQueue.pop();

    if (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.size() << std::endl;

        std::queue<int> tempQueue = myQueue;
        while (!tempQueue.empty()) {
            std::cout << tempQueue.front() << " ";
            tempQueue.pop();
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    std::queue<int>().swap(myQueue); // Clearing the queue

    return 0;
}
```

This is just a basic overview. There are more advanced operations and use cases for queues in C++, but these are the fundamental operations you'll commonly use.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max Subarray (Sliding Window + Deque)

Certainly! Implementing the maximum subarray problem using the sliding window technique along with a deque (double-ended queue) in C++ can be an efficient approach. Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

vector<int> maxSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (nums.empty() || k <= 0 || k > nums.size()) return result;

    deque<int> dq;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // Remove elements from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window
        if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() == i - k)
            dq.pop_front();

        // Remove elements from the back of the deque if they are smaller than the current element
        while (!dq.empty() && nums[i] >= nums[dq.back()])
            dq.pop_back();

        dq.push_back(i);

        // Add the maximum element of the current window to the result vector
        if (i >= k - 1)
            result.push_back(nums[dq.front()]);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7};
    int k = 3;

    vector<int> result = maxSubarray(nums, k);

    cout << "Maximum subarray elements for each window of size " << k << ":" << endl;
    for (int num : result)
        cout << num << " ";
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code finds the maximum subarray elements for each window of size `k` using a deque. It iterates through the array, maintaining a sliding window of size `k`. At each step, it updates the deque to contain only elements within the current window that might be the maximum. The maximum element of each window is then pushed into the result vector.

You can adjust the input array `nums` and the window size `k` in the `main` function to test different scenarios.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Member functions of Queue

In C++, when implementing a queue data structure, you typically have member functions that allow you to manipulate the queue, such as enqueueing elements, dequeueing elements, checking if the queue is empty, and accessing the front element without dequeuing it. Here's a basic example of what these member functions might look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Queue {
private:
    queue<int> q;

public:
    // Function to add an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int value) {
        q.push(value);
    }

    // Function to remove an element from the queue
    void dequeue() {
        if (!q.empty()) {
            q.pop();
        } else {
            cout << "Queue is empty. Cannot dequeue." << endl;
        }
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return q.empty();
    }

    // Function to get the front element of the queue without removing it
    int front() {
        if (!q.empty()) {
            return q.front();
        } else {
            cout << "Queue is empty. No front element." << endl;
            return -1; // Return a default value indicating empty queue
        }
    }

    // Function to get the size of the queue
    int size() {
        return q.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue myQueue;

    myQueue.enqueue(10);
    myQueue.enqueue(20);
    myQueue.enqueue(30);

    cout << "Front element: " << myQueue.front() << endl;
    cout << "Queue size: " << myQueue.size() << endl;

    myQueue.dequeue();
    cout << "Front element after dequeue: " << myQueue.front() << endl;
    cout << "Queue size after dequeue: " << myQueue.size() << endl;

    myQueue.dequeue();
    myQueue.dequeue();

    cout << "Is the queue empty? " << (myQueue.isEmpty() ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the basic functionalities of a queue: enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, front, and size. You can build upon this by adding more functionalities or modifying it as per your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): More on Queue From Stack

Certainly! Implementing a queue using stacks is a classic exercise in data structures. In C++, you can achieve this by using two stacks. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class Queue {
private:
    stack<int> inbox;  // For enqueue operation
    stack<int> outbox; // For dequeue operation

public:
    // Function to enqueue an element to the queue
    void enqueue(int element) {
        inbox.push(element);
    }

    // Function to dequeue an element from the queue
    int dequeue() {
        if (outbox.empty()) {
            // If outbox is empty, transfer elements from inbox to outbox
            while (!inbox.empty()) {
                outbox.push(inbox.top());
                inbox.pop();
            }
        }

        // Pop the top element from outbox
        if (!outbox.empty()) {
            int front = outbox.top();
            outbox.pop();
            return front;
        } else {
            // If both stacks are empty, queue is empty
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // You can handle this situation differently based on your needs
        }
    }

    // Function to check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return inbox.empty() && outbox.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;

    // Enqueue some elements
    q.enqueue(1);
    q.enqueue(2);
    q.enqueue(3);

    // Dequeue elements
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 1
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 2

    // Enqueue more elements
    q.enqueue(4);
    q.enqueue(5);

    // Dequeue remaining elements
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 3
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 4
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print 5

    // Try to dequeue when queue is empty
    cout << q.dequeue() << endl; // Should print "Queue is empty!"

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We have two stacks: `inbox` and `outbox`.
- `inbox` is used for the enqueue operation, and `outbox` is used for the dequeue operation.
- When we dequeue an element, if the `outbox` is empty, we transfer all elements from `inbox` to `outbox`. This way, the oldest element enqueued in the queue becomes the top element in the `outbox`.
- We keep dequeuing from the `outbox` until it's empty. If both `inbox` and `outbox` are empty, we consider the queue empty.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Moving rear and front in Circular Queue

In C++, implementing a circular queue involves managing the front and rear pointers appropriately. Here's a basic implementation that demonstrates how to move the rear and front pointers in a circular queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 5

class CircularQueue {
private:
    int items[SIZE], front, rear;

public:
    CircularQueue() {
        front = -1;
        rear = -1;
    }

    // Check if the queue is full
    bool isFull() {
        if ((front == 0 && rear == SIZE - 1) || (rear == (front - 1) % (SIZE - 1)))
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        if (front == -1)
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Add an element to the queue
    void enQueue(int element) {
        if (isFull()) {
            cout << "Queue is full" << endl;
        } else {
            if (front == -1)
                front = 0;
            rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE;
            items[rear] = element;
            cout << element << " enqueued to the queue." << endl;
        }
    }

    // Remove an element from the queue
    int deQueue() {
        int element;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
            return -1;
        } else {
            element = items[front];
            if (front == rear) {
                front = -1;
                rear = -1;
            } else {
                front = (front + 1) % SIZE;
            }
            return element;
        }
    }

    // Display the queue
    void display() {
        int i;
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "Queue is empty." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Front: " << front << endl;
            cout << "Items: ";
            for (i = front; i != rear; i = (i + 1) % SIZE)
                cout << items[i] << " ";
            cout << items[i] << endl;
            cout << "Rear: " << rear << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularQueue q;

    // Adding elements to the queue
    q.enQueue(1);
    q.enQueue(2);
    q.enQueue(3);
    q.enQueue(4);
    q.enQueue(5);

    // Display the queue
    q.display();

    // Removing elements from the queue
    cout << "Dequeued item: " << q.deQueue() << endl;
    cout << "Dequeued item: " << q.deQueue() << endl;

    // Display the queue
    q.display();

    // Adding more elements after dequeuing
    q.enQueue(6);
    q.enQueue(7);

    // Display the queue
    q.display();

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a circular queue with a fixed size of 5. The `enQueue` function adds elements to the queue, and the `deQueue` function removes elements. The front and rear pointers are adjusted accordingly to make the queue circular.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Printing all the Elements of a Queue

Certainly! In C++, you can print all the elements of a queue by dequeuing each element until the queue becomes empty. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Function to print all elements of a queue
void printQueue(queue<int> q) {
    while (!q.empty()) {
        cout << q.front() << " ";
        q.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create a queue
    queue<int> myQueue;

    // Push some elements into the queue
    myQueue.push(10);
    myQueue.push(20);
    myQueue.push(30);
    myQueue.push(40);
    myQueue.push(50);

    // Print all elements of the queue
    cout << "Elements of the queue: ";
    printQueue(myQueue);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `printQueue` function takes a queue as a parameter and prints all its elements. It does so by repeatedly dequeuing elements until the queue becomes empty, printing each element as it goes. Finally, in the `main` function, we create a queue, push some elements into it, and then call `printQueue` to print all the elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue

A priority queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that manages a set of elements each associated with a priority. It allows for efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority. In C++, the `std::priority_queue` is available in the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue.

Here's a basic example of how to use `std::priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Access the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Remove the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Access the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Check if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty())
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Priority queue is not empty\n";

    // Get the size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `std::priority_queue<int>` creates a priority queue of integers. You can specify the type of the elements inside the angle brackets (`<>`).
- `pq.push(value)` inserts an element into the priority queue.
- `pq.top()` returns the top element (element with the highest priority) without removing it.
- `pq.pop()` removes the top element from the priority queue.
- `pq.empty()` checks if the priority queue is empty.
- `pq.size()` returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

You can also define your own comparison function for custom priorities or use a custom data type with its own comparison function. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

struct CustomType {
    int value;
    // Define a comparison function for CustomType
    bool operator<(const CustomType& other) const {
        return value < other.value; // Change < to > for min priority queue
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of CustomType
    std::priority_queue

```cpp


```cpp
    <CustomType> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push({10});
    pq.push({30});
    pq.push({20});

    // Access the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top().value << std::endl;

    // Remove the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Access the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top().value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `CustomType` is a custom data type with an integer value. We overload the `<` operator to define the comparison based on the `value` member variable. This allows us to use `CustomType` with `std::priority_queue`, and the priority queue will be ordered based on the `value` of each element.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue Problems

Sure, priority queues are an essential data structure in computer science, often implemented using heaps. They are commonly used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, among others. Here are a few classic problems that you can solve using priority queues in C++:

1. **Merge K Sorted Lists**:
   Given K sorted lists, merge them into one sorted list. You can use a priority queue to efficiently merge them.

2. **Top K Frequent Elements**:
   Given an array of integers, return the K most frequent elements. You can use a priority queue to keep track of the frequency of elements.

3. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**:
   Given an unsorted array of integers, find the Kth largest element. You can use a min-heap to efficiently find the Kth largest element.

4. **Find Median from Data Stream**:
   Design a data structure that supports adding integers to the data structure and finding the median of the elements currently present. You can use two priority queues, one for the smaller half of the elements (max-heap) and one for the larger half (min-heap).

5. **Task Scheduler**:
   Given a sequence of tasks represented by characters, each task could be done in one interval. You need to find the minimum time to finish all the tasks, given a non-negative integer n, which represents the cooldown interval between two same tasks. You can use a priority queue to schedule the tasks efficiently.

6. **Huffman Coding**:
   Huffman coding is a method used for lossless data compression. Given a set of characters and their frequencies, build a Huffman tree and generate the Huffman codes for each character. Priority queues are used to build the Huffman tree efficiently.

7. **Super Ugly Number**:
   Write a program to find the nth super ugly number. Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k. You can use a priority queue to generate super ugly numbers efficiently.

These are just a few examples of problems that can be solved using priority queues in C++. Each of these problems requires understanding the priority queue operations like insertion, deletion, and accessing the top element efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue STL

A priority queue is a data structure that maintains a set of elements, each associated with a priority. Its primary operations are inserting an element with a priority, and extracting the element with the highest priority. In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) `priority_queue` to implement a priority queue efficiently. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define a priority queue of integers
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print the elements of the priority queue
    cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 50 30 20 10
```

By default, `priority_queue` is implemented as a max heap, where the element with the highest value is at the top. If you want to use a min heap instead, where the element with the lowest value is at the top, you can define your priority queue like this:

```cpp
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
```

Here's a breakdown of the template parameters:

- `int`: The data type of the elements.
- `vector<int>`: The underlying container used to store the elements. In this case, a vector is used, but you can also use other containers like `deque`.
- `greater<int>`: The comparison function used to determine the priority. `greater<int>` creates a min heap, while the default `less<int>` creates a max heap.

You can also customize the priority queue by providing your own comparison function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Different Algorithms

Certainly! Priority queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to manage a collection of elements with associated priorities. They are particularly useful when you need to retrieve elements in order of priority rather than in the order they were inserted. In C++, you typically implement priority queues using the `std::priority_queue` container from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Here are some common algorithms and operations involving priority queues:

1. **Insertion**: Adding an element with a priority to the priority queue. This operation typically has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

2. **Extraction**: Removing and returning the element with the highest priority (or lowest priority, depending on the implementation). This operation also has a time complexity of O(log n).

3. **Heapify**: Converting an array of elements into a heap structure. This operation can be done in linear time, O(n), using algorithms such as heapify or build_heap.

4. **Merging**: Combining two priority queues into one. This operation generally requires merging the underlying heaps, which can be done in O(n) time.

5. **Changing Priority**: Modifying the priority of an element already in the priority queue. This operation can be tricky and often involves removing the element and re-inserting it with the new priority, which can take O(n) time in the worst case.

6. **Top k Elements**: Retrieving the top k elements with the highest (or lowest) priority. This can be done by extracting elements one by one until you have the desired number.

7. **Heap Sort**: Using a priority queue to sort elements. You can insert all elements into the priority queue and then extract them one by one, which sorts them in the desired order. This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n).

8. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A famous graph traversal algorithm that uses a priority queue to greedily select the next vertex to explore based on the shortest known distance. This algorithm is commonly used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

9. **Prim's Algorithm**: Another graph algorithm similar to Dijkstra's, but used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It also utilizes a priority queue to greedily select the next edge to include in the tree.

These are just a few examples of algorithms and operations involving priority queues. They are incredibly versatile and have applications in various fields, including operating systems, networking, and computational biology, among others.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Immutable and Concurrent Collections

In C++, implementing immutable and concurrent priority queues can be a bit challenging due to the language's lack of built-in support for immutability and concurrency. However, it's definitely achievable with some effort and careful design.

### Immutable Priority Queue

An immutable data structure doesn't allow modification of its contents after creation. You can implement an immutable priority queue by ensuring that all operations return a new priority queue object instead of modifying the existing one. You can do this by using copy-on-write techniques or persistent data structures.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement an immutable priority queue in C++:

```cpp
template<typename T, typename Compare = std::less<T>>
class ImmutablePriorityQueue {
private:
    std::priority_queue<T, std::vector<T>, Compare> data;

public:
    ImmutablePriorityQueue() = default;

    ImmutablePriorityQueue(std::initializer_list<T> init) : data(init) {}

    ImmutablePriorityQueue push(const T& value) const {
        ImmutablePriorityQueue<T, Compare> newQueue(*this);
        newQueue.data.push(value);
        return newQueue;
    }

    ImmutablePriorityQueue pop() const {
        ImmutablePriorityQueue<T, Compare> newQueue(*this);
        newQueue.data.pop();
        return newQueue;
    }

    const T& top() const {
        return data.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        return data.empty();
    }

    // Other methods like size(), clear(), etc.
};
```

### Concurrent Priority Queue

Implementing a concurrent priority queue requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety. You can use mutexes or atomic operations to achieve this. Here's a basic example using mutexes:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

template<typename T, typename Compare = std::less<T>>
class ConcurrentPriorityQueue {
private:
    std::priority_queue<T, std::vector<T>, Compare> data;
    mutable std::mutex mutex;
    std::condition_variable cv;

public:
    ConcurrentPriorityQueue() = default;

    void push(const T& value) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        data.push(value);
        cv.notify_one();
    }

    T pop() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        cv.wait(lock, [this] { return !data.empty(); });
        T value = data.top();
        data.pop();
        return value;
    }

    const T& top() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        return data.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        return data.empty();
    }

    // Other methods like size(), clear(), etc.
};
```

This implementation uses a mutex to guard access to the underlying data structure, ensuring that only one thread can modify it at a time. The condition variable (`cv`) is used to signal waiting threads when the queue is not empty, allowing them to proceed.

Keep in mind that these implementations are basic and may need enhancements depending on your specific requirements, especially for concurrent data structures where correctness and performance are critical. Also, consider using existing libraries like Intel TBB or Boost for more robust concurrent data structures if they fit your project requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Implementation - Insert

Certainly! A priority queue is a data structure similar to a regular queue or stack data structure, but with each element assigned a priority. In C++, you can implement a priority queue using a variety of underlying data structures, such as a heap. Here's a basic implementation of a priority queue using a binary heap:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<int> heap;

    // Helper function to maintain heap property after insertion
    void heapifyUp(int index) {
        int parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        while (index > 0 && heap[index] > heap[parent]) {
            swap(heap[index], heap[parent]);
            index = parent;
            parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    PriorityQueue() {}

    // Insert element into the priority queue
    void insert(int value) {
        heap.push_back(value);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    // Utility function to print the priority queue
    void print() {
        for (int i = 0; i < heap.size(); ++i) {
            cout << heap[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueue pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.insert(10);
    pq.insert(20);
    pq.insert(15);
    pq.insert(30);
    pq.insert(5);

    // Print the priority queue
    pq.print();

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We use a `vector` to store the elements of the priority queue. This allows us to easily resize the underlying array as needed.
- The `heapifyUp` function is used to maintain the heap property after inserting an element into the priority queue. It compares the inserted element with its parent and swaps them if necessary to restore the heap property.
- The `insert` function inserts a new element into the priority queue by appending it to the end of the `vector` and then calling `heapifyUp` to restore the heap property.
- The `print` function is a utility function to print the elements of the priority queue.

You can run this code to see how elements are inserted into the priority queue and how the heap property is maintained.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Insert

Certainly! In C++, you can use the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue. To insert elements into a priority queue, you typically use the `push()` member function.

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to insert elements into a `priority_queue`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Define a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Display the elements of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We include the necessary headers (`iostream` and `queue`).
- We declare a priority queue `pq` of integers.
- We insert elements into the priority queue using the `push()` member function.
- Finally, we display the elements of the priority queue by repeatedly popping elements using `top()` to get the highest priority element and `pop()` to remove it.

This code will output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 30 20 10
```

This demonstrates that the priority queue maintains the elements in descending order based on their priority.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Insert Function

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). The `priority_queue` is implemented as a heap, which allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of the maximum (or minimum) element.

Here's how you can implement the insert function for a priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Function to insert an element into the priority queue
template<typename T>
void insertIntoPriorityQueue(priority_queue<T>& pq, const T& element) {
    pq.push(element);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    priority_queue<int> pq; // Creating a priority queue of integers

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 10);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 5);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 20);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 15);

    // Printing elements of the priority queue
    cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We define a function `insertIntoPriorityQueue` that takes a reference to a `priority_queue` and the element to be inserted.
- Inside the function, we simply use the `push` function of the `priority_queue` to insert the element.
- In the `main` function, we create a `priority_queue` of integers and insert some elements into it using the `insertIntoPriorityQueue` function.
- Finally, we print the elements of the priority queue by repeatedly popping elements from it.

This demonstrates the basic usage of inserting elements into a priority queue in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Nearby Cars

Using a priority queue in C++ for managing nearby cars is a common scenario, especially in applications like ride-sharing services or autonomous vehicle navigation systems. The priority queue can be used to efficiently retrieve the nearest cars based on their distance from a given location. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure to represent a car
struct Car {
    int id;
    double x, y; // Coordinates of the car
    // Constructor
    Car(int _id, double _x, double _y) : id(_id), x(_x), y(_y) {}
    // Function to calculate distance between two cars
    double distance(const Car& other) const {
        return sqrt(pow(x - other.x, 2) + pow(y - other.y, 2));
    }
};

// Custom comparator for comparing cars based on their distance from a given location
struct CompareCars {
    Car reference_point;
    CompareCars(const Car& ref) : reference_point(ref) {}
    bool operator()(const Car& a, const Car& b) const {
        return a.distance(reference_point) > b.distance(reference_point);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Define the reference point
    Car reference_point(0, 0, 0); // Assuming reference point is at (0, 0)

    // Priority queue of cars, ordered by distance from the reference point
    priority_queue<Car, vector<Car>, CompareCars> nearby_cars(CompareCars(reference_point));

    // Adding some cars to the priority queue
    nearby_cars.push(Car(1, 3, 4));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(2, -1, 2));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(3, 5, 1));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(4, -2, -3));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(5, 0, 0));

    // Retrieve the nearest car
    Car nearest_car = nearby_cars.top();
    cout << "Nearest car ID: " << nearest_car.id << ", Distance: " << nearest_car.distance(reference_point) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `Car` structure to represent each car, storing its ID and coordinates (x, y).
- We define a custom comparator `CompareCars` to compare cars based on their distance from a reference point.
- We use a priority queue of cars, with the custom comparator `CompareCars`, to store nearby cars ordered by their distance from the reference point.
- We add some cars to the priority queue and retrieve the nearest car using the `top()` function of the priority queue.

You can adapt this code to your specific requirements, such as using real-time location updates for cars or integrating it into a larger application.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Reduced array size to half

Reducing the size of a priority queue (or any dynamic array-based data structure) to half its capacity typically involves creating a new array with half the size and copying elements from the old array to the new one. In C++, you can achieve this by using dynamic memory allocation and the `std::copy` algorithm. Here's a basic example of how you might implement this operation for a priority queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy

template <typename T>
class PriorityQueue {
private:
    T* array;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t size;

    void resize(size_t newCapacity) {
        T* newArray = new T[newCapacity];
        std::copy(array, array + size, newArray);
        delete[] array;
        array = newArray;
        capacity = newCapacity;
    }

public:
    PriorityQueue() : array(nullptr), capacity(0), size(0) {}

    void push(const T& value) {
        // Check if resize is needed before pushing
        if (size + 1 > capacity) {
            resize(capacity == 0 ? 1 : capacity * 2);
        }
        // Push value into the priority queue
        // (not implemented in this example)
    }

    void pop() {
        // Pop the top element from the priority queue
        // (not implemented in this example)
    }

    // Other member functions...

    ~PriorityQueue() {
        delete[] array;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    PriorityQueue<int> pq;
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(3);
    pq.push(8);
    // Perform some operations...

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `resize` function doubles the capacity of the array when needed.
- The `push` function checks if the array needs resizing before adding an element.
- `std::copy` is used to copy elements from the old array to the new array during resizing.
- The destructor deallocates the dynamically allocated memory.

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might need additional functionalities like popping elements, peeking at the top element, or comparing elements for ordering.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Relative Ranks

Sure, I can help you with that! A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `std::priority_queue` container from the `<queue>` header.

To assign relative ranks to elements in a priority queue, you typically need to perform some operations when inserting elements or when retrieving them. Here's how you could implement a priority queue with relative ranks in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to assign relative ranks to elements
vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Create a copy of nums to keep track of original positions
    vector<int> sorted_nums = nums;
    sort(sorted_nums.rbegin(), sorted_nums.rend()); // Sort in descending order

    // Map to store the original position of each number
    unordered_map<int, int> position_map;
    for (int i = 0; i < sorted_nums.size(); ++i) {
        position_map[sorted_nums[i]] = i + 1;
    }

    // Vector to store result ranks
    vector<string> result(nums.size());

    // Assign ranks
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int rank = position_map[nums[i]];
        if (rank == 1)
            result[i] = "Gold Medal";
        else if (rank == 2)
            result[i] = "Silver Medal";
        else if (rank == 3)
            result[i] = "Bronze Medal";
        else
            result[i] = to_string(rank);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {10, 3, 8, 9, 4};
    vector<string> ranks = findRelativeRanks(nums);
    
    cout << "Relative Ranks:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        cout << nums[i] << ": " << ranks[i] << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `findRelativeRanks` function takes a vector of integers `nums` as input and returns a vector of strings representing the relative ranks of the numbers. The ranks are assigned based on the sorted order of the numbers. The function first creates a sorted copy of the input vector and then creates a map to store the original position of each number in the sorted order. Then, it iterates through the input vector, looks up the rank of each number in the map, and assigns the appropriate rank string to the result vector. Finally, the main function demonstrates the usage of this function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Min & Complexity Analysis

In C++, removing the minimum element from a priority queue can be achieved using the `pop()` method. The `pop()` method removes the top element from the priority queue, which is the minimum (or maximum, depending on how you've configured the priority queue).

Here's a simple example of how you can remove the minimum element from a priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert some elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(15);

    // Remove the minimum element
    pq.pop();

    // Now the top element should be the next minimum
    std::cout << "Minimum element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In terms of complexity analysis:

- Removing the minimum element from a priority queue implemented with a binary heap (the most common implementation) has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue. This is because removing the minimum element involves rearranging the heap to maintain its heap property, which requires logarithmic time relative to the number of elements.

- The space complexity of removing the minimum element from a priority queue is O(1) because the operation doesn't require additional space proportional to the input size. The space complexity of the priority queue itself depends on its implementation, but typically it's O(n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Min Solution & Complexity Analysis

Certainly! In C++, the `priority_queue` container from the Standard Template Library (STL) can be utilized to implement a priority queue. However, it doesn't provide a direct method to remove the minimum element. Instead, we typically simulate removal by accessing the top element (minimum element), popping it, and then reconstructing the priority queue without that element. Let's write a function to remove the minimum element from a `priority_queue` and analyze its complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Function to remove the minimum element from a priority queue
template <typename T>
void removeMin(priority_queue<T>& pq) {
    // Create a temporary priority queue to hold elements
    priority_queue<T> temp;
    
    // Pop the top element (minimum element)
    pq.pop();
    
    // Transfer elements from original pq to temp, excluding the removed element
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        temp.push(pq.top());
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    // Transfer elements back to original pq from temp
    while (!temp.empty()) {
        pq.push(temp.top());
        temp.pop();
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    priority_queue<int> pq;
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(2);
    pq.push(7);
    pq.push(1);
    
    cout << "Before removal: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    // Restore elements and remove minimum
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(2);
    pq.push(7);
    pq.push(1);
    removeMin(pq);
    
    cout << "After removal: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This function `removeMin()` works as follows:

1. It pops the top (minimum) element from the priority queue.
2. It then transfers the remaining elements from the original priority queue to a temporary one, effectively excluding the removed minimum element.
3. After that, it transfers the elements back to the original priority queue from the temporary one.

Let's analyze the time complexity of this `removeMin()` function:

- Popping the top element from a priority queue takes O(log n) time complexity.
- Transferring elements from one priority queue to another takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

So, the overall time complexity of the `removeMin()` function is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Minimum

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). However, `priority_queue` doesn't have a direct method to remove the minimum element. Typically, you would remove the top element, which is the minimum by default.

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use `priority_queue` and remove the minimum element:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(15);
    pq.push(5);

    // Printing the elements of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop(); // Removing the top element (minimum)
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 20 15 10 5
```

As you can see, the elements are printed in descending order because `priority_queue` is a max-heap by default. If you want to use a min-heap, you can specify the comparison function.

If you need to remove a specific minimum element, you might consider using a different data structure such as a set or a multiset, where you can iterate through and remove specific elements based on your criteria.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm used to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit. It's an efficient way to find primes and is based on the principle of iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. Here's how you can implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes using C++ with a priority queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void sieveOfEratosthenes(int n) {
    // Create a boolean vector "prime[0..n]" and initialize
    // all entries as true.
    vector<bool> prime(n + 1, true);

    // Create a priority queue to store the primes.
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; ++p) {
        // If prime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime
        if (prime[p] == true) {
            // Update all multiples of p
            for (int i = p * p; i <= n; i += p)
                prime[i] = false;
        }
    }

    // Store primes in the priority queue
    for (int p = 2; p <= n; ++p)
        if (prime[p])
            pq.push(p);

    // Print the primes in ascending order
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the upper limit for prime numbers: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Prime numbers up to " << n << " are:\n";
    sieveOfEratosthenes(n);

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code uses a boolean vector `prime` to mark whether a number is prime or not. It iterates through the numbers, marking multiples of each prime number as not prime. Finally, it stores the primes found in a priority queue and prints them out in ascending order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Weakest Rows

To implement a priority queue for the "Weakest Rows" problem, you'll need a way to prioritize rows based on their strength. In this problem, the strength of a row is defined as the number of soldiers in it. We can use a min-heap to store pairs of (strength, index), where strength is the number of soldiers and index is the row index. This way, when we pop from the priority queue, we'll get the row with the weakest soldiers first.

Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

vector<int> kWeakestRows(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    // Priority queue to store pairs of (strength, index)
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    
    // Iterate through each row, calculate strength and push into the priority queue
    for (int i = 0; i < mat.size(); ++i) {
        int strength = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].size(); ++j) {
            strength += mat[i][j];
        }
        pq.push({strength, i});
    }
    
    // Extract the k weakest rows from the priority queue
    vector<int> result;
    while (k-- > 0 && !pq.empty()) {
        result.push_back(pq.top().second);
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
        {1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
    };
    int k = 3;
    
    vector<int> weakest = kWeakestRows(mat, k);
    
    cout << "The indices of the k weakest rows are: ";
    for (int idx : weakest) {
        cout << idx << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we first iterate through each row of the matrix, calculate its strength (i.e., the sum of elements), and push a pair of (strength, index) into the priority queue. Then, we pop the k weakest rows from the priority queue and return their indices.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues

Priority queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to maintain a set of elements with associated priorities. They are often implemented as heaps due to their efficient insertion and removal operations.

In C++, you can use the `std::priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue. Here's a basic overview of how to use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of priority queue
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Printing the top element after removal
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is not empty.\n";
    }

    // Size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::priority_queue<int>` creates a priority queue of integers. You can change `int` to any other data type or define your own custom comparison function if you need to prioritize elements differently.

Key operations include:

- `push(value)`: Inserts an element into the priority queue.
- `pop()`: Removes the top element from the priority queue.
- `top()`: Accesses the top (highest priority) element in the priority queue.
- `empty()`: Checks if the priority queue is empty.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

Priority queues are often used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and Huffman coding. They provide efficient access to the element with the highest priority, making them indispensable in many applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues (Heaps)

Priority queues are essential data structures in computer science, particularly for scenarios where elements need to be processed based on their priority. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues efficiently. Here's a brief overview of priority queues and heaps in the context of C++:

### Priority Queues

- **Definition**: A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack, but each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.
  
- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Adds an element with a priority to the queue.
  - **Deletion**: Removes the element with the highest priority from the queue.
  - **Peek**: Returns the element with the highest priority without removing it from the queue.
  
- **Implementation**: Priority queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, binary heaps, or balanced binary search trees. Binary heaps are one of the most common implementations due to their efficiency.

### Heaps

- **Definition**: A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min heap, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
  
- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
  - **Deletion**: Removes the root node (the maximum or minimum value) from the heap and restores the heap property.
  - **Heapify**: Converts an array of elements into a heap.
  
- **Implementation**: Heaps are commonly implemented using arrays due to their compact representation. In a binary heap, the parent of the node at index \(i\) is at index \((i-1)/2\), and its children are at indices \(2i+1\) and \(2i+2\).

### C++ Implementation

C++ provides the `priority_queue` container adapter in the `<queue>` header, which implements a priority queue using a heap by default. You can also implement heaps from scratch using arrays or dynamic memory allocation.

Here's an example of using `priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;
    
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This would output: `30 20 10`.

For more control or specific requirements, you may need to implement your heap or priority queue from scratch, especially if you need to customize the behavior or performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues & Heaps

Priority queues and heaps are fundamental data structures used in computer science and algorithm design, particularly for tasks that require efficient prioritization or ordering of elements. In C++, you can implement priority queues using the standard library's `priority_queue` container, which internally uses a heap data structure.

Here's an overview of priority queues and heaps in C++:

### Priority Queues

A priority queue is a type of container in which elements are popped based on their priority. Elements with higher priority are popped before elements with lower priority. Priority queues typically support operations like insertion and deletion of elements, as well as retrieval of the highest-priority element without removing it.

In C++, you can use the `priority_queue` container provided by the `<queue>` header.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(5);

    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    pq.pop();
    std::cout << "Top element after popping: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Heaps

A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children, and in a min heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its children. Heaps are often implemented as arrays, where the parent-child relationships are determined by the indices of the array elements.

In C++, the `priority_queue` container typically uses a max heap, but you can implement your own heap data structure if you need more control.

**Example of a Max Heap:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void heapify(std::vector<int>& arr, int n, int i) {
    int largest = i;
    int left = 2 * i + 1;
    int right = 2 * i + 2;

    if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
        largest = left;

    if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
        largest = right;

    if (largest != i) {
        std::swap(arr[i], arr[largest]);
        heapify(arr, n, largest);
    }
}

void buildMaxHeap(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        heapify(arr, n, i);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
    buildMaxHeap(arr);

    std::cout << "Max Heap: ";
    for (int num : arr)
        std::cout << num << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates building a max heap from an array. You can modify it for a min heap by changing the comparison logic.

Understanding priority queues and heaps is essential for various algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and efficient sorting algorithms like heap sort. They offer efficient insertion and removal of elements based on their priority, making them invaluable tools in algorithm design and optimization.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: array representation

In C++, priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, particularly binary heaps. Binary heaps can be easily represented using arrays. Here's a basic explanation of how to represent a priority queue using an array in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<int> heap;

    // Helper functions
    int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; }
    int leftChild(int i) { return (2 * i) + 1; }
    int rightChild(int i) { return (2 * i) + 2; }

    // Rearranges elements to maintain heap property
    void heapifyUp(int i) {
        while (i > 0 && heap[parent(i)] < heap[i]) {
            swap(heap[parent(i)], heap[i]);
            i = parent(i);
        }
    }

        }

        if (i != maxIndex) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[maxIndex]);

        }
    }

public:

    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a basic implementation of a priority queue using a max-heap. The `PriorityQueue` class uses a vector to store elements, where each element is inserted into the appropriate position in the heap according to its priority. The `insert()` function inserts a new element into the heap while maintaining the heap property, the `extractMax()` function removes and returns the maximum element from the heap, and the `getMax()` function returns the maximum element without removing it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: basics

Sure, let's dive into the basics of priority queues in C++.

A priority queue is a data structure that manages a set of elements with priorities. The elements are stored in such a way that the element with the highest (or lowest) priority can be accessed quickly. Priority queues are commonly implemented using heaps, which are specialized binary trees.

In C++, the standard library provides the `priority_queue` class, which is a part of the `<queue>` header file. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a priority queue of integers, inserts some elements into it, accesses the top element, removes the top element, and then accesses the new top element.

By default, the `priority_queue` is a max heap, which means the element with the highest value will be at the top. If you want to create a min heap (where the smallest element is at the top), you can specify a custom comparator function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Custom comparator function for min heap
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) {
        return a > b; // Returns true if a should go before b in the priority queue
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers with custom comparator
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, Compare> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `Compare` is a struct defining the custom comparator function. The function returns true if `a` should go before `b` in the priority queue, effectively creating a min heap.

That's the basics of priority queues in C++ using the standard library. They are quite handy for tasks where you need to process elements in order of priority.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: remove operation

In C++, priority queues don't typically support a direct remove operation like standard containers such as vectors or sets. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using other data structures in combination with the priority queue.

One common approach is to use an additional data structure, like a map or a set, to keep track of the elements' positions in the priority queue. Here's a simple example using a map:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class PriorityQueueWithRemove {
private:
    priority_queue<T> pq;
    unordered_map<T, int> index; // Maps element to its index in the priority queue

public:
    void push(const T& val) {
        pq.push(val);
        index[val] = pq.size(); // Index is 1-based
    }

    void remove(const T& val) {
        if (index.find(val) == index.end()) return; // Element not found

        int idx = index[val];
        index.erase(val);

        // Swap with the last element and pop
        if (idx != pq.size()) {
            T last = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(last);
            index[last] = idx;
        }
        pq.pop(); // Remove the duplicated last element
    }

    T top() const {
        return pq.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        return pq.empty();
    }

    size_t size() const {
        return pq.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueueWithRemove<int> pq;
    pq.push(3);
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(1);
    pq.push(7);

    cout << "Current top: " << pq.top() << endl; // Should print 7

    pq.remove(5); // Remove element 5

    cout << "After removal, new top: " << pq.top() << endl; // Should print 7

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `index` map keeps track of the index of each element in the priority queue. When removing an element, it swaps the element with the last one in the queue and then pops it. This approach allows for a pseudo-removal operation with logarithmic complexity. Keep in mind that the actual removal might not be very efficient compared to direct removal in other data structures.

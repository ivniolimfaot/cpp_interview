# Binary Serch Trees: General

## AVL Trees

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Concept of Binary Tree Data Structure

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root.

Here are some key concepts associated with binary trees:

1. **Root**: The topmost node in the tree. It serves as the starting point for tree traversal.

2. **Node**: Each element in the tree. A node contains some data and pointers/references to its left and right children (if they exist).

3. **Parent, Child, Siblings**: In a binary tree, each node (except the root) has exactly one parent and can have zero, one, or two children. Nodes with the same parent are called siblings.

4. **Leaf**: A node with no children is called a leaf node or a terminal node.

5. **Height**: The height of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of the tree itself is the height of the root node.

6. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root node to that node.

7. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Binary trees can be traversed in different ways:

- **In-order traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- **Pre-order traversal**: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- **Post-order traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

Binary trees are widely used in computer science for various applications such as representing hierarchical data structures, organizing data for quick search and retrieval (in the case of binary search trees), and implementing algorithms like binary tree sort and expression trees for evaluating mathematical expressions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Balanced Search Trees

Balanced search trees are a fundamental data structure used in computer science for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They maintain a balance property that ensures that the height of the tree remains relatively small, which guarantees efficient performance for operations like search, insert, and delete.

One of the most commonly used balanced search trees is the **AVL tree**. It is named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the height difference between the left and right subtrees (called the balance factor) of any node is at most 1. When a node is inserted or deleted, if the balance factor of any node violates this property, rotations are performed to restore balance.

Another widely used balanced search tree is the **Red-Black tree**. Red-Black trees are binary search trees that satisfy several properties, including the coloring of nodes as red or black and constraints on how these colors can be assigned to nodes. These properties ensure that the tree remains balanced.

Balanced search trees offer efficient average-case time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations. For AVL trees and Red-Black trees, these operations typically have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. However, in the worst case, some operations might have a slightly higher time complexity due to the need for rebalancing.

In C++, you can implement balanced search trees such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees using either custom implementations or utilizing libraries like the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The `std::set` and `std::map` containers in the STL are typically implemented using Red-Black trees or similar balanced search tree variants.

Here's a simple example of using `std::set` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

int main() {
    std::set<int> balancedTree;

    // Insert elements into the balanced tree
    balancedTree.insert(10);
    balancedTree.insert(20);
    balancedTree.insert(5);

    // Check if an element exists
    if (balancedTree.find(20) != balancedTree.end()) {
        std::cout << "Element 20 found in the tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element 20 not found in the tree." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the basic usage of `std::set`, which is implemented using a balanced binary search tree. Similar operations can be performed using `std::map` for key-value pairs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Balanced VS Unbalanced Binary Search Trees

Balanced and unbalanced binary search trees are two different approaches to organizing data in a tree structure for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

1. **Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**
   - In a balanced binary search tree, such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, or Splay trees, the height of the tree is kept close to logarithmic, ensuring that the operations like searching, insertion, and deletion have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree.
   - These trees automatically adjust their structure after insertion or deletion to maintain balance, ensuring that the tree remains relatively shallow and efficient.
   - Popular balanced BSTs include AVL trees and Red-Black trees. AVL trees maintain strict balance criteria, while Red-Black trees relax the balance criteria slightly for faster insertion and deletion.
   - Balanced trees are suitable for situations where there are frequent insertions and deletions, and maintaining a reasonably balanced tree is crucial for performance.

2. **Unbalanced Binary Search Trees:**
   - Unbalanced binary search trees do not have any constraints on their structure, meaning their height can become significantly larger than logarithmic.
   - Operations like searching, insertion, and deletion in unbalanced trees can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This occurs when the tree resembles a linked list, and every operation requires traversing through all elements.
   - Examples of unbalanced binary search trees include basic binary trees and binary search trees where elements are inserted in sorted order without rebalancing.
   - Unbalanced trees are simpler to implement but can suffer from performance degradation for certain operations if they become heavily skewed.

In summary, the choice between balanced and unbalanced binary search trees depends on the specific requirements of the application. Balanced trees offer guaranteed logarithmic performance for all operations but require more complex maintenance algorithms. Unbalanced trees are simpler but can suffer from degraded performance if not managed carefully.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree Class

Sure, I can provide you with a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) class in C++. Here's a simplified version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
class BSTNode {
public:
    T data;
    BSTNode<T>* left;
    BSTNode<T>* right;

    BSTNode(T value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

template<typename T>
class BST {
private:
    BSTNode<T>* root;

    BSTNode<T>* insertHelper(BSTNode<T>* node, T value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new BSTNode<T>(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertHelper(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertHelper(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    void inorderTraversalHelper(BSTNode<T>* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inorderTraversalHelper(node->left);
            std::cout << node->data << " ";
            inorderTraversalHelper(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    void insert(T value) {
        root = insertHelper(root, value);
    }

    void inorderTraversal() {
        inorderTraversalHelper(root);
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BST<int> bst;
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    bst.inorderTraversal();

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and supports insertion and inorder traversal. You can expand it by adding more functionalities like deletion, searching, preorder/postorder traversal, balancing, etc., depending on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree Class ADT with Insert(), Delete() and Search()

Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) class in C++ with the functions Insert(), Delete(), and Search(). This implementation assumes that the tree doesn't contain duplicate values.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class TreeNode {
public:
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    TreeNode* findMinNode(TreeNode* node) {
        while (node->left != nullptr) {
            node = node->left;
        }
        return node;
    }

    TreeNode* deleteRecursive(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = deleteRecursive(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = deleteRecursive(node->right, value);
        } else {
            // Node to delete found

            // Node with only one child or no child
            if (node->left == nullptr) {
                TreeNode* temp = node->right;
                delete node;
                return temp;
            } else if (node->right == nullptr) {
                TreeNode* temp = node->left;
                delete node;
                return temp;
            }

            // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
            TreeNode* temp = findMinNode(node->right);

            // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
            node->data = temp->data;

            // Delete the inorder successor
            node->right = deleteRecursive(node->right, temp->data);
        }
        return node;
    }

    bool searchRecursive(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (value == node->data) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < node->data) {
            return searchRecursive(node->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchRecursive(node->right, value);
        }
    }

public:
    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    void deleteNode(int value) {
        root = deleteRecursive(root, value);
    }

    bool search(int value) {
        return searchRecursive(root, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    BinarySearchTree bst;

    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    // Should print 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
    // Inorder traversal of a BST gives elements in sorted order
    // as it visits nodes in non-decreasing order
    bst.inorderTraversal(bst.getRoot());
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Searching for 70: " << (bst.search(70) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;
    cout << "Searching for 25: " << (bst.search(25) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << endl;

    bst.deleteNode(20);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting 20: ";
    // Should print 30 40 50 60 70 80
    bst.inorderTraversal(bst.getRoot());
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your needs, you may want to expand upon it. For example, you might want to add additional functions like traversals (pre-order, post-order), height calculation, balancing operations, etc., for a more complete Binary Search Tree implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search tree creation and insertion

Creating and inserting elements into a binary search tree (BST) in C++ involves defining a node structure for the tree and implementing functions to perform insertion. Below is a basic example demonstrating how to create a binary search tree and insert elements into it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node structure for the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it as the root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new Node(val);
    }
    // If the value is less than the root's value, insert into the left subtree
    else if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value is greater than or equal to the root's value, insert into the right subtree
    else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print the binary search tree in inorder traversal
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;

    // Insert elements into the binary search tree
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);

    // Print the binary search tree in inorder traversal
    std::cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `Node` struct to represent each node in the binary search tree. The `insert` function is used to insert elements into the tree according to the properties of a binary search tree. Finally, the `inorderTraversal` function is used to print the elements of the binary search tree in sorted order.

You can run this code to see how it creates a binary search tree and prints its elements in sorted order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): BInary search tree deletion

In C++, deleting a node from a binary search tree (BST) involves a few steps, especially considering different cases like the node being a leaf, having one child, or having two children. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement the deletion operation for a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

// Function to create a new Node
Node* createNode(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->left = newNode->right = nullptr;
    return newNode;
}

// Function to insert a new Node in BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int data) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = createNode(data);
    } else if (data <= root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, data);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, data);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to find the minimum value Node in BST
Node* minValueNode(Node* node) {
    Node* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr) {
        current = current->left;
    }
    return current;
}

// Function to delete a Node from BST
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root; // Empty tree

    if (key < root->data) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->data) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else { // Node to delete found
        // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        // Case 2: Node has two children
        Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        root->data = temp->data;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print the BST in inorder traversal
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    root = insert(root, 2);
    root = insert(root, 4);
    root = insert(root, 6);
    root = insert(root, 8);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 3); // Deleting node with value 3

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to delete a node from a binary search tree in C++. The `deleteNode()` function handles different cases for deletion - no child, one child, and two children. The `minValueNode()` function finds the node with the minimum value in the right subtree, which is needed when the node to be deleted has two children. Finally, the `inorder()` function is used to print the BST in inorder traversal to verify the correctness of the deletion operation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree Implementation

Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node definition for the BST
class Node {
public:
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int k) {
        key = k;
        left = right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Binary Search Tree class
class BST {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function to recursively insert a key into the BST
    Node* insertUtil(Node* node, int key) {
        // If the tree is empty, create a new node as the root
        if (node == nullptr)
            return new Node(key);

        // Otherwise, recur down the tree
        if (key < node->key)
            node->left = insertUtil(node->left, key);
        else if (key > node->key)
            node->right = insertUtil(node->right, key);

        return node;
    }

    // Helper function to perform inorder traversal recursively
    void inorderUtil(Node* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inorderUtil(node->left);
            cout << node->key << " ";
            inorderUtil(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    BST() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Function to insert a key into the BST
    void insert(int key) {
        root = insertUtil(root, key);
    }

    // Function to perform inorder traversal of the BST
    void inorder() {
        inorderUtil(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;

    // Insert elements into the BST
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    // Print inorder traversal of the BST
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    bst.inorder();
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation provides basic functionalities such as insertion and inorder traversal. You can extend it to include other operations like deletion, search, preorder, and postorder traversals as needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search tree searching

Binary search tree (BST) searching in C++ involves traversing the tree to find a specific element efficiently. Here's a basic implementation of searching in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int data) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(data);
    }
    
    if (data <= root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, data);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, data);
    }
    
    return root;
}

// Function to search for a value in the BST
bool search(Node* root, int data) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false; // Value not found
    }
    
    if (root->data == data) {
        return true; // Value found
    } else if (data < root->data) {
        return search(root->left, data); // Search in the left subtree
    } else {
        return search(root->right, data); // Search in the right subtree
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    
    // Insert some elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);
    
    // Search for elements in the BST
    cout << "Searching for 20: " << (search(root, 20) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    cout << "Searching for 90: " << (search(root, 90) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` struct to represent each node in the BST. The `insert` function inserts a new node into the tree based on its value, and the `search` function searches for a value in the BST by recursively traversing the tree.

You can run this code to see how the searching works in a binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Big O

The Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Here's a breakdown of its Big O time complexity for various operations:

1. **Search (Average Case)**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - In a balanced BST, the search operation takes logarithmic time as it divides the search space in half at each step. This assumes the tree is balanced, ensuring that the height of the tree remains logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes.

2. **Search (Worst Case)**:
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - In the worst-case scenario, where the BST is skewed (e.g., all elements are inserted in a sorted order), the tree degenerates into a linked list. In this case, the search operation may require traversing through all the nodes, resulting in linear time complexity.

3. **Insertion**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average
   - Similar to search, insertion also takes logarithmic time in a balanced BST. However, in the worst case (when the tree is skewed), it can take O(n) time as well.

4. **Deletion**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) on average
   - Like insertion, deletion also takes logarithmic time on average. But in the worst-case scenario (when the tree is skewed), it can take O(n) time.

5. **Traversal**:
   - In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversal of a BST all have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node needs to be visited once.

It's important to note that the performance of BST operations heavily depends on the balance of the tree. Keeping the tree balanced ensures that operations maintain their logarithmic time complexity guarantees. There are also variations of BSTs, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, which ensure better balance and thus improve worst-case performance guarantees.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Binary Search for a Binary Search Tree

To perform a binary search on a binary search tree (BST) in C++, you typically follow these steps:

1. Start at the root node.
2. Compare the target value with the value of the current node.
3. If the target value matches the current node's value, return the node.
4. If the target value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child node (if it exists) and repeat steps 2-4 recursively.
5. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right child node (if it exists) and repeat steps 2-4 recursively.
6. If you reach a leaf node (a node with no children) and haven't found the target value, the value is not in the tree.

Here's a sample C++ code demonstrating binary search in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        // Base cases: root is null or target is found at root.
        if (root == nullptr || root->val == target)
            return root;

        // Target is greater than root's value, search in right subtree.
        if (root->val < target)
            return search(root->right, target);

        // Target is smaller than root's value, search in left subtree.
        return search(root->left, target);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    int target = 6;
    TreeNode* result = bst.search(root, target);
    if (result)
        std::cout << "Found: " << result->val << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Not found." << std::endl;

    // Free memory (not necessary in most modern C++ implementations)
    // Implementation of freeing memory depends on the tree structure.
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `TreeNode` represents each node in the binary search tree. The `BST` class contains the `search` method, which recursively searches for the target value in the binary search tree starting from the root node. In the `main` function, a sample binary search tree is created, and then the `search` method is called to find a target value (in this case, 6).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Constructor

In C++, a binary search tree (BST) is a data structure composed of nodes. Each node has a key (or value), a left child, and a right child. The key in each node must be greater than all keys stored in the left sub-tree, and less than all keys stored in the right sub-tree.

Here's how you might implement a constructor for a binary search tree class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure for a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    // Constructor to initialize the node
    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the Binary Search Tree class
class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    Node* root;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the BST
    BinarySearchTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Other member functions can be defined here
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    BinarySearchTree bst;
    // You can now use the BST object to perform operations like insertion, deletion, searching, etc.
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` is a struct representing a node in the binary search tree. It contains a key, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child. The constructor `Node(int k)` initializes the key and sets the left and right pointers to `nullptr`.
- `BinarySearchTree` is a class representing the binary search tree itself. It contains a pointer to the root node of the tree. The constructor `BinarySearchTree()` initializes the root pointer to `nullptr`.
- The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `BinarySearchTree` class by creating an instance of it (`bst`). You can now use this instance to perform various operations on the binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Contains

To implement a `contains` function for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++, you need to traverse the tree by comparing the target value with the current node's value and then decide whether to go left or right based on the comparison. Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Insert a value into the BST
    void insert(int val) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, val);
    }

    // Helper function to insert a value recursively
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* node, int val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }

        if (val < node->val) {
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, val);
        } else if (val > node->val) {
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, val);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Check if the BST contains a given value
    bool contains(int val) {
        return containsRecursive(root, val);
    }

    // Helper function to check if the value exists recursively
    bool containsRecursive(TreeNode* node, int val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (val == node->val) {
            return true;
        } else if (val < node->val) {
            return containsRecursive(node->left, val);
        } else {
            return containsRecursive(node->right, val);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;
    bst.insert(5);
    bst.insert(3);
    bst.insert(7);
    bst.insert(1);
    bst.insert(4);

    std::cout << "BST contains 3? " << (bst.contains(3) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "BST contains 6? " << (bst.contains(6) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `insert` function adds elements to the BST in their appropriate positions. The `contains` function checks whether a given value exists in the BST or not by traversing the tree recursively. If the value is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Delete in Binary Search Trees

Deleting a node in a binary search tree (BST) is a bit more complex than insertion. When you delete a node, you need to maintain the binary search tree property. There are three cases to consider when deleting a node:

1. Node to be deleted has no children (leaf node): In this case, you simply remove the node from the tree.
2. Node to be deleted has one child: In this case, you bypass the node and link its parent directly to its child.
3. Node to be deleted has two children: In this case, you need to find the node's in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree), copy its data to the node to be deleted, and then delete the in-order successor.

Here's the C++ code to delete a node from a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;

    // Find the leftmost leaf
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;

    return current;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    // Base case: if the tree is empty
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // Traverse down the tree
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else { // Found the node to be deleted
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Utility function to print the inorder traversal of the BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 30;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary search tree and provides a function `deleteNode()` to delete a node with a given key. The `minValueNode()` function finds the minimum value node in the right subtree, which is used to replace the node to be deleted when it has two children.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Deletion

In C++, deleting a node from a binary search tree (BST) involves several cases to consider:

1. **Deleting a Leaf Node**: If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove it from the tree.

2. **Deleting a Node with One Child**: If the node has only one child, replace the node with its child.

3. **Deleting a Node with Two Children**: If the node has two children, find the node with the smallest value in its right subtree (or the node with the largest value in its left subtree), replace the node's value with that node's value, and then recursively delete that node (which will fall into one of the first two cases).

Here's a C++ implementation for deleting a node from a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Helper function to find the minimum value node in a subtree
TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;
    return current;
}

// Function to delete a node from BST
TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    // If the key to be deleted is greater than the root's key, then it lies in the right subtree
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    // If key is same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;
        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int key = 30;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to delete a node from a BST in C++. It includes the implementation of the `deleteNode` function and a simple `main` function to test the deletion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Deletion Case-Leaf Node

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), deleting a node involves several cases depending on the structure of the tree and the node to be deleted. When deleting a node from a BST, you need to consider three cases:

1. Deleting a leaf node (a node with no children).
2. Deleting a node with one child.
3. Deleting a node with two children.

Let's focus on the case of deleting a leaf node. Here's how you would handle it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a node in BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (!root) return new TreeNode(val);
    if (val < root->val) root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    else if (val > root->val) root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    return root;
}

// Function to delete a node from BST
TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (!root) return nullptr;

    // If the key is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);

    // If the key is greater than the root's key, then it lies in the right subtree
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);

    // If key is same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (!root->left) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (!root->right) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = root->right;
        while (temp->left) temp = temp->left;

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 20); // Deleting leaf node
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents a node in the BST.
- `insert` function inserts a new node into the BST maintaining its properties.
- `deleteNode` function deletes a node from the BST, handling all three cases.
- `inorder` function prints the inorder traversal of the BST.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST, print its inorder traversal, delete a leaf node (20 in this case), and print the inorder traversal again to see the effect of deletion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Deletion Case-Node with Both Subtrees

In a binary search tree (BST), deleting a node with both subtrees can be a bit tricky because you need to maintain the BST property after deletion. Here's how you can handle this case in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the minimum value node in a BST
TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr) {
        node = node->left;
    }
    return node;
}

// Function to delete a node with both subtrees in a BST
TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

    // Search for the node to delete
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        // Node found, perform deletion

        // Case 1: Node has no child or only one child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Case 2: Node has both left and right subtrees
        // Replace the node with the minimum value node in the right subtree
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(10);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 5;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a `TreeNode` structure representing a node in the binary tree.
2. The `deleteNode` function takes the root of the tree and the key to be deleted.
3. If the key is less than the current node's value, we recursively call `deleteNode` on the left subtree.
4. If the key is greater, we call it on the right subtree.
5. If the key is found, we handle the deletion cases:
   - If the node has no children or only one child, we simply remove it.
   - If the node has both left and right subtrees, we find the minimum value node in the right subtree, replace the node's value with that node's value, and then delete that minimum value node from the right subtree.
6. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the `deleteNode` function in the `main` function by creating a BST and deleting a node from it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Deletion Case-Node with One Subtree

In a binary search tree (BST), deleting a node with one subtree involves a few steps to maintain the properties of the BST. Here's how you can handle this case in C++:

1. **Identify the Node to Delete**: First, you need to locate the node you want to delete.

2. **Determine the Type of Subtree**: Check if the node to be deleted has a left subtree, a right subtree, or both.

3. **Handle the Different Cases**:
   - If the node has only a left subtree or only a right subtree:
     - Connect the parent of the node to be deleted directly to the only child of that node.
   - If the node has both left and right subtrees:
     - Find the minimum (or maximum) node in the right (or left) subtree.
     - Replace the node to be deleted with this minimum (or maximum) node.
     - Delete the minimum (or maximum) node from its current position.

Here's a sample implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the minimum node in a subtree
TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* root) {
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to delete a node from BST
TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree
    if (key < root->data) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    }
    // If the key to be deleted is greater than the root's key, then it lies in the right subtree
    else if (key > root->data) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    }
    // If key is same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->data = temp->data;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int key = 30;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to delete a node with one subtree in a BST while maintaining the properties of the BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: In-Order traversal for a Binary Search Tree

In-order traversal is one of the fundamental ways to traverse a binary tree. In the case of a binary search tree (BST), it visits the nodes in ascending order of their keys.

Here's how you can perform an in-order traversal for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to perform in-order traversal recursively
    void inOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;
        
        // Visit left subtree
        inOrder(root->left);
        
        // Visit root
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        
        // Visit right subtree
        inOrder(root->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);

    // Create an instance of the Solution class
    Solution solution;

    // Perform in-order traversal
    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    solution.inOrder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```bash
In-order traversal: 2 3 4 5 7 8 9
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure for the nodes of the binary search tree and a `Solution` class with a method `inOrder` to perform in-order traversal recursively. In the `main` function, a sample binary search tree is created, and its in-order traversal is performed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Insert

Sure, I can walk you through implementing the insertion operation for a binary search tree (BST) in C++. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node with the given key into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key);
    }
    
    // Otherwise, recursively insert into the left or right subtree
    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }
    
    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to perform an inorder traversal of the BST (for testing purposes)
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->key << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;
    
    // Insert some keys into the BST
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    
    // Perform an inorder traversal to verify the BST structure
    inorderTraversal(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `Node` structure represents each node in the binary search tree. The `insert` function recursively inserts a new node with the given key into the tree while maintaining the binary search tree property. Finally, the `inorderTraversal` function is used to print out the keys of the nodes in sorted order, which helps to verify that the BST structure is maintained.

You can run this code to see how the insertion operation works in practice. Feel free to modify or extend it as needed!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: insert operation

Certainly! Below is a basic implementation of the insert operation for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for each node in the BST
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new key into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new Node(key);

    // Otherwise, recur down the tree
    if (key < root->key)
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->key)
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);

    // Return the (unchanged) root pointer
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST (for testing)
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    inorder(root->left);
    std::cout << root->key << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

// Test the insert operation
int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` structure for each node in the BST and implements the `insert` function to insert a new key into the BST. The `insert` function follows the rules of a BST, recursively traversing the tree to find the appropriate position for the new key.

The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `insert` function to build a BST and prints its inorder traversal for verification.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Is Binary Search Tree?

A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that satisfies the following properties:

1. Each node has at most two child nodes, usually referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. For any given node in the tree, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
3. The tree is ordered or sorted, meaning that an in-order traversal of the tree will visit nodes in non-decreasing order of their values.

In C++, you can implement a binary search tree using classes and pointers. Each node in the tree typically contains a value and pointers to its left and right children.

Here's a simple example of a node class for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

And here's an example of a binary search tree class:

```cpp
class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* node, int val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }
        if (val < node->val) {
            node->left = insert(node->left, val);
        } else if (val > node->val) {
            node->right = insert(node->right, val);
        }
        return node;
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    void insert(int val) {
        root = insert(root, val);
    }
};
```

This is a basic implementation, and you can add more functionalities like deletion, search, traversal algorithms, etc., depending on your requirements. Just remember to maintain the properties of a binary search tree while implementing these operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Iterative Search

Sure, let's dive into an iterative search function for a binary search tree in C++. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node definition for the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform iterative search in a binary search tree
Node* search(Node* root, int key) {
    while (root != nullptr) {
        if (key == root->data) {
            return root; // Key found
        } else if (key < root->data) {
            root = root->left; // Search in the left subtree
        } else {
            root = root->right; // Search in the right subtree
        }
    }
    return nullptr; // Key not found
}

// Function to insert a new node in the binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key); // Create a new node if the tree is empty
    }

    // Traverse the tree to find the appropriate position for the new node
    Node* current = root;
    while (true) {
        if (key < current->data) {
            if (current->left == nullptr) {
                current->left = new Node(key);
                break;
            } else {
                current = current->left;
            }
        } else if (key > current->data) {
            if (current->right == nullptr) {
                current->right = new Node(key);
                break;
            } else {
                current = current->right;
            }
        } else {
            // Duplicate keys are not allowed in BST
            break;
        }
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the binary search tree
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->data << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary search tree: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int key = 70;
    Node* result = search(root, key);
    if (result != nullptr) {
        std::cout << key << " found in the binary search tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << key << " not found in the binary search tree." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a basic binary search tree structure along with functions for iterative search and insertion. The `search` function iteratively searches for a given key in the binary search tree, while the `insert` function inserts a new node into the tree. Finally, the `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions by creating a binary search tree, performing an inorder traversal, and searching for a key.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Mirror a Binary Search Trees

To mirror a binary search tree (BST) in C++, you essentially swap the left and right children of each node in the tree recursively. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void mirrorBST(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    
    // Swap left and right children
    TreeNode* temp = root->left;
    root->left = root->right;
    root->right = temp;
    
    // Recursively mirror left and right subtrees
    mirrorBST(root->left);
    mirrorBST(root->right);
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the tree (for verification)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Sample BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    
    // Print original BST
    std::cout << "Original BST (inorder traversal): ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Mirror the BST
    mirrorBST(root);
    
    // Print mirrored BST
    std::cout << "Mirrored BST (inorder traversal): ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This program first creates a sample binary search tree, then mirrors it using the `mirrorBST` function, and finally prints the inorder traversal of both the original and mirrored BSTs to verify the transformation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: pre and post order traversal

In C++, you can implement pre-order and post-order traversals for a binary search tree (BST) using recursion. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    // Function to perform pre-order traversal
    void preOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;

        // Print the current node's value
        std::cout << root->val << " ";

        // Traverse left subtree
        preOrder(root->left);

        // Traverse right subtree
        preOrder(root->right);
    }

    // Function to perform post-order traversal
    void postOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;

        // Traverse left subtree
        postOrder(root->left);

        // Traverse right subtree
        postOrder(root->right);

        // Print the current node's value
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a sample BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);

    BST bst;

    std::cout << "Pre-order traversal: ";
    bst.preOrder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    bst.postOrder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // (not shown in this simple example to keep it concise)
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `preOrder` function performs pre-order traversal, where each node is visited before its child nodes.
- `postOrder` function performs post-order traversal, where each node is visited after its child nodes.

You can create a binary search tree and call these functions to perform pre-order and post-order traversals respectively.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Print in Range

To print all the elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that fall within a given range `[low, high]`, you can perform an in-order traversal of the BST and print the nodes that have values within the specified range. Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void printInRange(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    
    // Traverse the left subtree if root->val is greater than low
    if (root->val > low)
        printInRange(root->left, low, high);
    
    // Print the node if its value is within the range
    if (root->val >= low && root->val <= high)
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
    
    // Traverse the right subtree if root->val is less than high
    if (root->val < high)
        printInRange(root->right, low, high);
}

// Function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(val);
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample Binary Search Tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(10);
    root->left = newNode(5);
    root->right = newNode(50);
    root->left->left = newNode(1);
    root->right->left = newNode(40);
    root->right->right = newNode(100);

    int low = 5;
    int high = 50;

    std::cout << "Nodes in the range [" << low << ", " << high << "]: ";
    printInRange(root, low, high);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code will print all the elements in the BST that lie within the range `[low, high]`. You can adjust the values of `low` and `high` according to your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Recursive Insertion

Sure, I can provide you with a C++ implementation of recursive insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST).

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the Binary Search Tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new value into the Binary Search Tree recursively
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }

    // If the value to be inserted is less than the current node's value, 
    // recursively insert it into the left subtree
    if (val < root->val) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value to be inserted is greater than or equal to the current node's value, 
    // recursively insert it into the right subtree
    else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }

    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the Binary Search Tree
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty Binary Search Tree
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert elements into the Binary Search Tree
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the Binary Search Tree
    std::cout << "Inorder Traversal of BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` struct represents each node of the Binary Search Tree, containing the value, left child, and right child.
- The `insert` function inserts a new value into the BST recursively by traversing the tree based on the comparison of values. If the value is less than the current node, it is inserted into the left subtree; otherwise, it is inserted into the right subtree.
- `inorderTraversal` function prints the inorder traversal of the BST, which results in a sorted sequence.
- In the `main` function, we create an empty BST, insert several elements into it, and then print the inorder traversal to verify that the elements are inserted in sorted order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Recursive Search

In C++, you can implement a recursive search function for a Binary Search Tree (BST) quite elegantly. Below is a simple example demonstrating how to do this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for each node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }
    if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to perform recursive search in BST
bool search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root->data == val) {
        return true;
    } else if (val < root->data) {
        return search(root->left, val);
    } else {
        return search(root->right, val);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    // Insert some nodes into the BST
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    
    // Perform searches
    std::cout << "Searching for 5: " << (search(root, 5) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Searching for 20: " << (search(root, 20) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` struct represents each node in the binary search tree, containing integer data, and pointers to left and right child nodes.
- `insert` function inserts a new node into the BST.
- `search` function performs recursive search in the BST. It returns `true` if the element is found, otherwise `false`.
- `main` function demonstrates the usage of `insert` and `search` functions by inserting some nodes into the BST and then searching for specific elements.

This code provides a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree with recursive search functionality in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Root To Leaf Paths

Certainly! Root to leaf paths in a binary search tree (BST) are the sequences of nodes starting from the root and ending at a leaf node. To find all such paths, you can perform a depth-first traversal of the tree. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to recursively find root to leaf paths
void findPaths(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Add current node's value to the path
    path.push_back(root->val);

    // If it's a leaf node, add the current path to the paths list
    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
        paths.push_back(path);
    } else {
        // Otherwise, continue DFS traversal
        if (root->left) findPaths(root->left, path, paths);
        if (root->right) findPaths(root->right, path, paths);
    }

    // Remove current node from the path to backtrack
    path.pop_back();
}

// Function to find all root to leaf paths in a binary tree
vector<vector<int>> rootToLeafPaths(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> paths;
    vector<int> path;
    findPaths(root, path, paths);
    return paths;
}

// Utility function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(val);
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(5);
    root->left = newNode(3);
    root->right = newNode(7);
    root->left->left = newNode(2);
    root->left->right = newNode(4);
    root->right->left = newNode(6);
    root->right->right = newNode(8);

    // Find and print root to leaf paths
    vector<vector<int>> paths = rootToLeafPaths(root);
    cout << "Root to leaf paths:" << endl;
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        for (int nodeVal : path) {
            cout << nodeVal << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure and implements functions to find all root to leaf paths in a binary tree. The `findPaths` function recursively traverses the tree and constructs paths, while the `rootToLeafPaths` function initiates the process. Finally, the `main` function creates a sample binary search tree, finds and prints all root to leaf paths.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree: Searching

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), searching for a specific element involves traversing the tree based on the properties of the BST. Here's how you can implement searching in a BST using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        // Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root
        if (root == nullptr || root->val == key)
            return root;
        
        // Key is greater than root's value
        if (root->val < key)
            return search(root->right, key);

        // Key is smaller than root's value
        return search(root->left, key);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(14);
    root->left->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(13);

    BST bst;
    
    // Search for a value in the BST
    int key = 6;
    TreeNode* result = bst.search(root, key);
    if (result)
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " is found in the BST." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " is not found in the BST." << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the BST, containing a value and pointers to its left and right children.
2. The `BST` class contains a `search` method that takes a pointer to the root node of the BST and the value to be searched.
3. The `search` method recursively searches for the key in the BST. If the key is equal to the current node's value, or if the current node is null, it returns the current node.
4. In the `main` function, a BST is created, and then the `search` method is called to find a specific value (`key`). Depending on whether the value is found or not, appropriate messages are printed.

This implementation assumes that the given BST is constructed properly and follows the rules of a binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing and storing data in a hierarchical manner. They provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations when the data is sorted. In C++, you can implement a binary search tree using classes and pointers.

Here's a basic implementation of a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Class for the Binary Search Tree
class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function for inserting a node recursively
    TreeNode* insertNode(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            node = new TreeNode(value);
        } else {
            if (value < node->data) {
                node->left = insertNode(node->left, value);
            } else {
                node->right = insertNode(node->right, value);
            }
        }
        return node;
    }

    // Helper function for searching a node recursively
    bool searchNode(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return false;
        } else if (node->data == value) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < node->data) {
            return searchNode(node->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchNode(node->right, value);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Method to insert a value into the BST
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertNode(root, value);
    }

    // Method to search for a value in the BST
    bool search(int value) {
        return searchNode(root, value);
    }
};

// Main function to test the binary search tree
int main() {
    BST tree;

    // Insert some values into the BST
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Search for some values in the BST
    std::cout << "Searching for 20: " << (tree.search(20) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Searching for 55: " << (tree.search(55) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a basic binary search tree with insertion and search functionalities. You can extend it to include deletion, traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder), and other operations based on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Insertion (Concept)

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, particularly for efficient searching and sorting operations. They are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The key property of a BST is that for every node, all nodes in its left subtree have keys less than the node's key, and all nodes in its right subtree have keys greater than the node's key. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

The insertion operation in a BST involves adding a new node to the tree while maintaining the binary search tree property. Here's how it works:

1. **Starting from the root node**, compare the key of the new node with the key of the current node.
2. If the key of the new node is less than the key of the current node, move to the left child.
3. If the key of the new node is greater than the key of the current node, move to the right child.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until reaching a null child pointer.
5. Create a new node with the given key and insert it as the left child if the key is less than the current node's key, or as the right child if the key is greater than the current node's key.

Let's see a C++ implementation of the insertion operation:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void insert(TreeNode *&root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new TreeNode(key);
        return;
    }
    
    if (key < root->val) {
        insert(root->left, key);
    } else {
        insert(root->right, key);
    }
}
```

In this implementation:

- We pass the root node by reference (`TreeNode *&root`) to modify it if necessary.
- If the tree is empty (`root == nullptr`), we create a new node with the given key and make it the root.
- Otherwise, we recursively traverse the tree to find the appropriate position for the new node based on the binary search tree property.
- Once we reach a null child pointer, we create a new node with the given key and insert it there.

It's important to note that the efficiency of a BST heavily depends on its balance. Unbalanced BSTs can degrade into linked lists, leading to inefficient operations. Techniques like AVL trees or Red-Black trees are used to maintain balance in BSTs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Iterative Insert Function

Sure, I can provide you with an example of an iterative implementation of the insert function for a binary search tree (BST) in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a value into the BST iteratively
    void insert(int val) {
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);
        if (!root) {
            root = newNode;
            return;
        }

        TreeNode* curr = root;
        TreeNode* parent = nullptr;
        while (curr) {
            parent = curr;
            if (val < curr->val)
                curr = curr->left;
            else
                curr = curr->right;
        }

        if (val < parent->val)
            parent->left = newNode;
        else
            parent->right = newNode;
    }

    // Function to print the tree in inorder traversal
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) {
            inorderTraversal(root->left);
            std::cout << root->val << " ";
            inorderTraversal(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Function to print the tree
    void printTree() {
        std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
        inorderTraversal(root);
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BST tree;
    // Insert some elements into the tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Print the tree
    tree.printTree();

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary search tree, containing an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `BST` class contains a pointer to the root of the binary search tree.
- The `insert` function iteratively inserts a new value into the BST by traversing the tree until it finds the appropriate position for the new node.
- The `printTree` function prints the elements of the tree in inorder traversal order.
- In the `main` function, we create a binary search tree object, insert some elements into it, and then print the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Iterative Search Function

Sure! Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, providing efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations. Here's how you can implement an iterative search function for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to search for a value in a binary search tree iteratively
TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    while (root != nullptr && root->val != val) {
        if (val < root->val) {
            root = root->left;
        } else {
            root = root->right;
        }
    }
    return root;
}

// Utility function to create a new node with the given value
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    return new TreeNode(val);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(5);
    root->left = newNode(3);
    root->right = newNode(7);
    root->left->left = newNode(2);
    root->left->right = newNode(4);
    root->right->left = newNode(6);
    root->right->right = newNode(8);

    // Search for a value in the tree
    int value_to_search = 6;
    TreeNode* result = search(root, value_to_search);

    // Check if the value was found
    if (result != nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Value " << value_to_search << " found in the tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Value " << value_to_search << " not found in the tree." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the binary search tree. Each node contains a value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `search` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and the value to search for. It iteratively traverses the tree, comparing the target value with the current node's value and moving left or right accordingly until it finds the value or reaches a leaf node (or a null node if the value is not present).
- In the `main` function, we create a binary search tree and then search for a specific value (`value_to_search`). Finally, we print whether the value was found in the tree or not.

This implementation performs the search operation in O(h) time complexity, where h is the height of the binary search tree. In the worst case, where the tree is unbalanced, the height can be O(n), making the worst-case time complexity of the search operation O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. However, in a balanced binary search tree, the height is O(log n), resulting in an average-case time complexity of O(log n) for the search operation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing a set of elements. It's a binary tree where each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a BST is that for every node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

Here's a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return new TreeNode(val);
        
        if (val < root->val)
            root->left = insert(root->left, val);
        else if (val > root->val)
            root->right = insert(root->right, val);

        return root;
    }

    TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == nullptr || root->val == val)
            return root;

        if (val < root->val)
            return search(root->left, val);
        else
            return search(root->right, val);
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    void insert(int val) {
        root = insert(root, val);
    }

    bool search(int val) {
        TreeNode* result = search(root, val);
        return result != nullptr;
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;
    bst.insert(5);
    bst.insert(3);
    bst.insert(7);
    bst.insert(1);
    bst.insert(4);

    std::cout << "Search 5: " << bst.search(5) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Search 2: " << bst.search(2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we have a `TreeNode` struct representing each node in the tree. The `BST` class provides methods to insert elements into the tree and search for elements within the tree. The `insert` function recursively inserts a new node into the appropriate position based on the BST property. The `search` function recursively searches for a given value in the tree.

This is a basic implementation; in a real-world scenario, you might want to add more functionalities like deletion, traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and balancing operations to ensure the tree remains relatively balanced for efficient searching.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Check If Balanced

To check if a binary search tree (BST) is balanced in C++, you can implement a function that calculates the height of each subtree and checks if the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of every node is not greater than 1. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to calculate the height of a tree
int height(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    
    return 1 + max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
}

// Function to check if a binary tree is balanced
bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return true;
    
    int leftHeight = height(root->left);
    int rightHeight = height(root->right);
    
    if (abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1 && isBalanced(root->left) && isBalanced(root->right))
        return true;
    
    return false;
}

// Test function
int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    if (isBalanced(root))
        cout << "Tree is balanced." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Tree is not balanced." << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct for the binary tree nodes, and two functions `height()` and `isBalanced()`. The `height()` function calculates the height of the tree rooted at a given node. The `isBalanced()` function recursively checks if the tree is balanced by comparing the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node.

Remember that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each node, we are calculating the height of its subtree, resulting in multiple height calculations for the same nodes. You can optimize this approach by calculating the height and checking for balance in a single traversal of the tree, which reduces the time complexity to O(n).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Depth First Search InOrder

In a binary search tree (BST), depth-first search (DFS) with an inorder traversal visits the nodes in non-decreasing order of their keys. This traversal strategy explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here's how you can implement depth-first search (inorder traversal) for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the BST
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform inorder traversal (DFS)
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    inorder(root->left);    // Recursively visit left subtree
    std::cout << root->val << " "; // Print the current node
    inorder(root->right);   // Recursively visit right subtree
}

// Function to insert a new node with a given key into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new TreeNode(key);
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Perform inorder traversal (DFS)
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal (DFS): ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree, containing an integer value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node with a given key into the BST while maintaining the BST property.
- The `inorder` function recursively performs inorder traversal (DFS) of the BST, printing the values of the nodes in non-decreasing order.
- In the `main` function, a sample binary search tree is created by inserting nodes with different keys. Then, inorder traversal is performed and printed to the console.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Depth First Search PostOrder

In C++, implementing a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for a binary search tree (BST) in postorder involves traversing the tree in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a node in the binary tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    // Constructor
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to perform postorder traversal
void postOrder(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    
    // Traverse left subtree
    postOrder(root->left);
    
    // Traverse right subtree
    postOrder(root->right);
    
    // Process current node
    cout << root->data << " ";
}

// Function to insert a new node into the binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new Node(value);

    if (value < root->data)
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    else if (value > root->data)
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);

    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Performing postorder traversal
    cout << "Postorder traversal: ";
    postOrder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a `Node` structure to represent each node in the binary search tree.
2. The `insert` function inserts a new node into the BST while maintaining its property.
3. The `postOrder` function recursively performs a postorder traversal of the BST, printing out the data of each node as it traverses.
4. In the `main` function, we create a sample BST and then call the `postOrder` function to perform the postorder traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Depth First Search PreOrder

In C++, implementing Depth First Search (DFS) PreOrder traversal on a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves visiting each node in the tree in the order of root, left subtree, right subtree. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform DFS PreOrder traversal
void preOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Process the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Traverse the left subtree
    preOrder(root->left);

    // Traverse the right subtree
    preOrder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(12);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Performing DFS PreOrder traversal
    std::cout << "DFS PreOrder Traversal: ";
    preOrder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Deleting the tree to avoid memory leaks (optional)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code first defines the structure for a TreeNode in the binary search tree. Then, it defines the `preOrder()` function to perform DFS PreOrder traversal recursively. Finally, it creates a sample binary search tree, calls the `preOrder()` function to traverse the tree, and deletes the allocated memory for the tree nodes at the end to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Find

Certainly! In C++, you can implement the find operation for a Binary Search Tree (BST) as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int data) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(data);
    }
    if (data < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, data);
    } else if (data > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, data);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to search for a value in the BST
bool find(Node* root, int data) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root->data == data) {
        return true;
    } else if (data < root->data) {
        return find(root->left, data);
    } else {
        return find(root->right, data);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;

    // Insert some elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    root = insert(root, 12);

    // Test find operation
    int key = 7;
    if (find(root, key)) {
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " found in the BST.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " not found in the BST.\n";
    }

    // Test with an element that doesn't exist
    key = 20;
    if (find(root, key)) {
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " found in the BST.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Element " << key << " not found in the BST.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `Node` struct represents each node in the Binary Search Tree.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node into the BST according to the rules of a BST (smaller values to the left, larger values to the right).
- The `find` function searches for a value in the BST recursively. If the value is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST, insert some elements, and then test the `find` operation with existing and non-existing elements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Insert

Certainly! Implementing the insertion operation for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ involves recursively traversing the tree to find the appropriate position for the new node based on its value. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node in the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it as the root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }

    // If the value is less than the current node's value, insert into the left subtree
    if (val < root->val) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value is greater than or equal to the current node's value, insert into the right subtree
    else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }

    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to print the BST (inorder traversal)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 5);
    insert(root, 3);
    insert(root, 7);
    insert(root, 2);
    insert(root, 4);
    insert(root, 6);
    insert(root, 8);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, `insert` function is a recursive function that inserts a new node with value `val` into the BST rooted at `root`. If the tree is empty (`root == nullptr`), it creates a new node with the given value. Otherwise, it recursively traverses the left or right subtree based on the value of the new node until it finds an appropriate position to insert the new node. The `inorderTraversal` function is used to print the BST in inorder traversal order, which results in a sorted sequence.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Insertion

Insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves placing a new node at the appropriate position in the tree while maintaining the BST property: the left child of a node contains elements smaller than the node, and the right child contains elements greater than the node.

Here's how you can implement insertion in a Binary Search Tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function for recursive insertion
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            root = new TreeNode(val);
            return root;
        }

        if (val < root->data) {
            root->left = insertRecursive(root->left, val);
        } else if (val > root->data) {
            root->right = insertRecursive(root->right, val);
        }

        return root;
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a value into the BST
    void insert(int val) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, val);
    }

    // Function to perform inorder traversal of the BST
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root != nullptr) {
            inorderTraversal(root->left);
            std::cout << root->data << " ";
            inorderTraversal(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Wrapper function for inorder traversal
    void inorder() {
        inorderTraversal(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    bst.inorder();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node of the tree.
- We define a `BST` class that contains the root of the tree and methods to insert values into the tree (`insert`) and perform inorder traversal (`inorderTraversal`).
- The `insert` function inserts a new value into the BST by calling the recursive helper function `insertRecursive`.
- The `insertRecursive` function recursively traverses the tree to find the appropriate position for the new value and inserts it.
- In the `main` function, we create a BST object, insert some values into it, and then perform an inorder traversal to verify that the values are inserted correctly.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Interview Question - Validate Binary Search Tree

Validating a Binary Search Tree (BST) in an interview scenario is a common problem. A BST is a binary tree where each node has at most two child nodes, and for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

Here's how you could approach validating a BST using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }

private:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long min_val, long max_val) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return true;
        
        if (root->val <= min_val || root->val >= max_val)
            return false;
        
        return isValidBST(root->left, min_val, root->val) &&
               isValidBST(root->right, root->val, max_val);
    }
};

// Test your implementation
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    std::cout << (solution.isValidBST(root) ? "Valid BST" : "Not a valid BST") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- The `TreeNode` struct defines the structure of a binary tree node.
- The `isValidBST` function is a public member function of the `Solution` class, which takes a pointer to the root of the tree and returns true if it is a valid BST, otherwise false.
- The private helper function `isValidBST` does the actual work. It takes the current node, along with the minimum and maximum values that the node's value can take. Initially, the minimum value is set to `LONG_MIN` and the maximum value is set to `LONG_MAX`.
- At each node, it checks whether the current node's value violates the BST property. If it does, it returns false. Otherwise, it recursively checks the left and right subtrees, updating the minimum and maximum values accordingly.
- In the `main` function, you can create a test tree and check whether it is a valid BST using the `isValidBST` function.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because it visits each node once.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree - Remove

In C++, removing a node from a binary search tree (BST) involves a few steps:

1. Find the node to remove.
2. If the node has no children, simply remove it.
3. If the node has one child, replace it with its child.
4. If the node has two children, find the node with the next greater value (inorder successor), which is the smallest node in the right subtree, and replace the node to be removed with it. Then, recursively remove the inorder successor from the right subtree.

Here's a basic implementation of the remove operation for a BST in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr)
        node = node->left;
    return node;
}

TreeNode* remove(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return nullptr;
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = remove(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = remove(root->right, key);
    else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest
        // in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;
        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = remove(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Utility function to print the tree (inorder traversal)
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion:";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    root = remove(root, 3);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion:";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // You can write a separate function for this if needed
    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of the remove operation for a BST. It's important to remember that this is a simplified version, and there are variations and optimizations possible depending on specific requirements and use cases.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Tree and its applications

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science used to efficiently store and retrieve sorted data. It has the following properties:

1. Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. The key (value) of every node in the left subtree is less than the key of the node itself.
3. The key of every node in the right subtree is greater than the key of the node itself.
4. The tree is recursively structured; both the left and right subtrees are themselves binary search trees.

#### Operations on Binary Search Tree

1. **Insertion:** To insert a new node into a BST, we compare the value of the new node with the value of the current node. If it's smaller, we go left; if it's larger, we go right until we find an empty spot to insert the new node.

2. **Deletion:** Removing a node from a BST can be a bit more complex because we need to maintain the properties of the BST after deletion. There are several cases to consider, including nodes with no children, nodes with one child, and nodes with two children.

3. **Searching:** Searching in a BST is efficient. We start from the root and compare the value we're searching for with the current node. If it matches, we return the node. If it's smaller, we go left; if it's larger, we go right. We continue this process until we find the node or reach a leaf node.

4. **Traversal:** There are three common types of traversals for binary trees:
   - **Inorder Traversal:** Visit left subtree, then the current node, then the right subtree.
   - **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
   - **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the current node.

#### Applications of Binary Search Trees

1. **Searching:** BSTs provide an efficient way to search for elements, especially when the data is sorted.

2. **Ordered Storage:** Data in a BST is automatically sorted, making it useful for applications where sorted data is needed.

3. **Range Queries:** BSTs can efficiently support range queries, where you need to find all elements within a given range.

4. **Symbol Table Implementation:** BSTs are commonly used to implement symbol tables, which are fundamental in compilers and interpreters.

5. **Self-balancing BSTs:** Variants of BSTs like AVL trees and Red-Black trees are used in implementing associative containers like sets and maps in C++ standard library because they provide guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

6. **Priority Queues:** Binary Heaps, a type of binary tree, are often used to implement priority queues, which are widely used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

Binary search trees are powerful data structures with various applications, and mastering them is essential for any programmer or computer scientist.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Recursive Insert Function

Certainly! In C++, you can implement a recursive insert function for a binary search tree (BST) like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int data) {
    // Base case: If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(data);
    }
    
    // If the data is less than the current node's data, insert it into the left subtree
    if (data < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, data);
    }
    // If the data is greater than the current node's data, insert it into the right subtree
    else if (data > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, data);
    }
    // If the data is equal to the current node's data, do nothing (duplicate values are not allowed in BST)
    
    // Return the updated root of the subtree
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST (for testing purposes)
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;
    
    // Insert some elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);
    
    // Print the inorder traversal of the BST
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a structure for a node in the binary search tree (`Node`), along with an `insert` function to recursively insert a new node into the BST based on its value. The `main` function demonstrates how to create a BST and insert elements into it, followed by printing the inorder traversal of the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Recursive Search Function

Certainly! A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Each node in a BST has at most two children: a left child and a right child. In a binary search tree, the value of all nodes in the left subtree is less than the value of the node, and the value of all nodes in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node.

Here's a recursive implementation of a search function for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Recursive function to search for a value in a binary search tree
TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty or the root's value matches the search value, return the root
    if (root == nullptr || root->val == val)
        return root;

    // If the search value is less than the root's value, search in the left subtree
    if (val < root->val)
        return searchBST(root->left, val);

    // If the search value is greater than the root's value, search in the right subtree
    return searchBST(root->right, val);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    // Create a binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Search for a value in the binary search tree
    int searchValue = 7;
    TreeNode* result = searchBST(root, searchValue);

    if (result)
        std::cout << "Value " << searchValue << " found in the tree." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Value " << searchValue << " not found in the tree." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary search tree.
- The `searchBST` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and the value to be searched for.
- If the tree is empty or if the root's value matches the search value, we return the root.
- If the search value is less than the root's value, we recursively search in the left subtree.
- If the search value is greater than the root's value, we recursively search in the right subtree.

This approach effectively searches through the binary search tree in a recursive manner until either the value is found or the search reaches a null node, indicating that the value is not present in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees - Searching (Concept)

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In a BST, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. Additionally, for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its value.

Searching in a BST involves comparing the target value with the value of the current node and navigating either to the left or right child accordingly, based on whether the target value is less than or greater than the current node's value. This process is repeated recursively until either the target value is found or a leaf node (a node with no children) is reached, indicating that the value is not present in the BST.

Here's a conceptual overview of the searching process in a BST:

1. Start at the root of the BST.
2. Compare the target value with the value of the current node.
3. If the target value is equal to the current node's value, the search is successful, and the node containing the target value is found.
4. If the target value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child and repeat the process recursively.
5. If the target value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right child and repeat the process recursively.
6. If a leaf node is reached (i.e., there are no more children to explore), the target value is not present in the BST.

The time complexity of searching in a BST is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the best case scenario, where the tree is balanced, the height of the tree is logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes (O(log n)), resulting in efficient search operations. However, in the worst-case scenario, where the tree is unbalanced (resembling a linked list), the height of the tree is linear with respect to the number of nodes (O(n)), resulting in less efficient search operations. Therefore, maintaining the balance of the BST is crucial for ensuring optimal performance.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Class

Sure, here's a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node class for BST
class TreeNode {
public:
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    // Constructor
    TreeNode(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Binary Search Tree class
class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function to insert a node recursively
    TreeNode* insertNode(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertNode(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertNode(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Helper function to search for a node recursively
    bool searchNode(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (value == node->data) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < node->data) {
            return searchNode(node->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchNode(node->right, value);
        }
    }

    // Helper function to traverse the tree in-order recursively
    void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inOrderTraversal(node->left);
            cout << node->data << " ";
            inOrderTraversal(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BST() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Public function to insert a node
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertNode(root, value);
    }

    // Public function to search for a node
    bool search(int value) {
        return searchNode(root, value);
    }

    // Public function to perform in-order traversal
    void inOrder() {
        inOrderTraversal(root);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

// Main function to test the BST class
int main() {
    BST tree;

    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    cout << "In-order traversal of the BST: ";
    tree.inOrder();

    cout << "Searching for value 40: " << (tree.search(40) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    cout << "Searching for value 45: " << (tree.search(45) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) class with basic functionalities such as insertion, searching, and in-order traversal. It consists of two classes: `TreeNode` for the nodes of the tree and `BST` for the Binary Search Tree itself. The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the BST class by inserting some nodes, performing an in-order traversal, and searching for values within the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Class Delete

Certainly! Below is an implementation of the `BinarySearchTree` class in C++ with the `deleteNode` method to delete a node from the binary search tree.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for BST
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function to find the minimum value node in a subtree
    Node* minValueNode(Node* node) {
        Node* current = node;
        while (current && current->left != nullptr)
            current = current->left;
        return current;
    }

    // Helper function to recursively delete a node with a given value
    Node* deleteNodeHelper(Node* root, int key) {
        if (root == nullptr) return root; // Base case: empty tree or node not found

        // Recur down the tree
        if (key < root->data)
            root->left = deleteNodeHelper(root->left, key);
        else if (key > root->data)
            root->right = deleteNodeHelper(root->right, key);
        else {
            // Node with only one child or no child
            if (root->left == nullptr) {
                Node* temp = root->right;
                delete root;
                return temp;
            } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
                Node* temp = root->left;
                delete root;
                return temp;
            }

            // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
            Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right);

            // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
            root->data = temp->data;

            // Delete the inorder successor
            root->right = deleteNodeHelper(root->right, temp->data);
        }
        return root;
    }

public:
    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Function to insert a new node with the given key
    void insert(int key) {
        root = insertHelper(root, key);
    }

    // Helper function to insert a new node recursively
    Node* insertHelper(Node* root, int key) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return new Node(key);
        }
        if (key < root->data) {
            root->left = insertHelper(root->left, key);
        } else if (key > root->data) {
            root->right = insertHelper(root->right, key);
        }
        return root;
    }

    // Function to delete a node with the given key
    void deleteNode(int key) {
        root = deleteNodeHelper(root, key);
    }

    // Function to do inorder traversal of the tree
    void inorder() {
        inorderHelper(root);
    }

    // Helper function to do inorder traversal recursively
    void inorderHelper(Node* root) {
        if (root != nullptr) {
            inorderHelper(root->left);
            cout << root->data << " ";
            inorderHelper(root->right);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    BinarySearchTree tree;

    // Inserting nodes
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the original tree: ";
    tree.inorder();
    cout << endl;

    // Deleting node with key 20, which has no child
    tree.deleteNode(20);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting node 20: ";
    tree.inorder();
    cout << endl;

    // Deleting node with key 30, which has one child
    tree.deleteNode(30);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting node 30: ";
    tree.inorder();
    cout << endl;

    // Deleting node with key 50, which has two children
    tree.deleteNode(50);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting node 50: ";
    tree.inorder();
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the usage of the `BinarySearchTree` class with insertion and deletion operations. It includes the `deleteNode` method to delete a node from the binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Class Insert

Sure, here's an example of how you can implement the insertion operation for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class TreeNode {
public:
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    BST() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Helper function to insert a new node
    TreeNode* insertNode(TreeNode* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < root->data) {
            root->left = insertNode(root->left, value);
        } else if (value > root->data) {
            root->right = insertNode(root->right, value);
        }

        return root;
    }

    // Function to insert a new node
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertNode(root, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST tree;

    // Inserting elements into the tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents a node in the BST, containing an integer value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
- `BST` represents the Binary Search Tree itself, with a pointer to the root node.
- The `insertNode` function is a recursive helper function used to insert a new node into the tree.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node into the tree by calling the `insertNode` function.

You can test the functionality by inserting elements into the tree and then performing various operations such as traversal, deletion, or searching.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types Of Binary Search Trees

In C++, binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. There are several types of binary search trees, each with unique properties that suit different applications. Here are some common types of binary search trees:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - The standard binary search tree where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
   - The key of a node is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree.
   - Basic operations such as search, insert, and delete can be performed efficiently on a BST.

2. **Balanced Binary Search Trees**:
   - These are binary search trees where the height of the tree is balanced, ensuring that operations like search, insert, and delete run in O(log n) time.
   - Common types of balanced BSTs include:
     - AVL trees: These are self-balancing binary search trees where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.
     - Red-Black trees: These are another type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node is either red or black, and certain properties are maintained to ensure balance.
     - Splay trees: These trees adapt to the access patterns of elements, bringing frequently accessed elements closer to the root, which can improve performance for certain applications.
     - Treaps: A combination of binary search trees and binary heaps, where each node has both a key and a priority.

3. **Binary Search Trees with Special Properties**:
   - Some binary search trees have special properties tailored for specific use cases:
     - Binary Heaps: Although not strictly binary search trees, binary heaps are a type of complete binary tree where each node satisfies the heap property (either min-heap or max-heap). They are commonly used to implement priority queues.
     - Binary Search Trees with Balanced Heights: These trees ensure that the height of the tree is balanced to minimize search time while not necessarily maintaining strict ordering properties.
     - Cartesian Trees: These are binary trees derived from a sequence of distinct elements, used in various algorithms for efficiently solving problems related to range queries.

Each type of binary search tree has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the application in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and expected operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of Binary Tree

In C++, binary trees are fundamental data structures consisting of nodes, each with at most two children: left and right. There are various types of binary trees, each with its own properties and applications. Here are some common types:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A binary tree where for each node, all elements in its left subtree are smaller, and all elements in its right subtree are greater.
   - Useful for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
   - In C++, you might define a BST node and implement functions for insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

2. **Balanced Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
   - Examples include AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees.
   - These trees ensure that operations remain logarithmic, ensuring better performance.

3. **Complete Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.
   - Efficiently implemented using an array, where the parent of node `i` is at `floor((i-1)/2)`, and children are at `2i + 1` and `2i + 2`.

4. **Full Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children.
   - Each non-leaf node has exactly two children.

5. **Perfect Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
   - It is both full and complete.

6. **Binary Heap**:
   - A complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater (or smaller) than or equal to the values of its children, known as a max-heap or min-heap, respectively.
   - Used for heap-based implementations of priority queues.

7. **Threaded Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree with additional pointers called threads, which are added to every node. These threads help in traversal.
   - Types include Inorder threaded binary tree, Preorder threaded binary tree, and Postorder threaded binary tree.

Each type of binary tree has its advantages and use cases, and understanding them helps in choosing the appropriate data structure for specific scenarios.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of Binary Trees

In C++, binary trees can take on various forms, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some common types of binary trees:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A binary search tree is a binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than or equal to the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node.
   - It supports efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations if the tree remains balanced.
   - In C++, you can implement a BST using classes and pointers.

2. **Balanced Binary Trees**:
   - These are binary trees where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
   - Examples include AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and Splay trees.
   - These trees ensure better performance in terms of time complexity for operations like search, insert, and delete compared to regular binary trees.
   - Libraries like `std::set` and `std::map` in C++ often use balanced binary trees internally for efficient operations.

3. **Complete Binary Tree**:
   - A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
   - It is typically implemented using arrays, where the array elements represent the nodes of the tree.

4. **Full Binary Tree**:
   - A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
   - All leaves are at the same level.

5. **Perfect Binary Tree**:
   - A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
   - It is both full and complete.

6. **Binary Heap**:
   - A binary heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. The heap property can be of two types: min-heap or max-heap.
   - In a min-heap, for any node 'i', the value of 'i' is less than or equal to the values of its children.
   - In a max-heap, for any node 'i', the value of 'i' is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
   - Binary heaps are often used to implement priority queues efficiently.

7. **Threaded Binary Trees**:
   - These are binary trees where all right child pointers that would normally be null instead point to the inorder successor (or predecessor) of the node.
   - This allows for efficient traversal without the need for recursion or a stack.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other types of binary trees and variations, each suited to specific applications and performance requirements. Implementing these in C++ often involves careful consideration of memory management, node structure, and algorithmic complexities.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Insertion

Sure, I'd be happy to explain how insertion works in a binary search tree (BST) using C++.

A binary search tree is a data structure that allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a binary search tree is that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its own value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its own value.

Here's a simple C++ implementation of a binary search tree with an insertion function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node in the binary search tree
void insertNode(TreeNode*& root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new TreeNode(val);
        return;
    }

    if (val < root->data) {
        insertNode(root->left, val); // Insert into the left subtree
    } else {
        insertNode(root->right, val); // Insert into the right subtree
    }
}

// Function to print the binary search tree (inorder traversal)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert some values into the binary search tree
    insertNode(root, 5);
    insertNode(root, 3);
    insertNode(root, 7);
    insertNode(root, 1);
    insertNode(root, 4);

    // Print the binary search tree (inorder traversal)
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary search tree: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a struct `TreeNode` representing a node in the binary search tree. Each node has an integer `data` value, and pointers to its left and right children.

2. The `insertNode` function inserts a new node with value `val` into the binary search tree rooted at `root`. It recursively traverses the tree to find the appropriate position to insert the new node based on the binary search tree property.

3. The `inorderTraversal` function performs an inorder traversal of the binary search tree, printing the values of the nodes in sorted order.

4. In the `main` function, we create an empty binary search tree represented by a pointer `root`. We then insert some values into the tree using the `insertNode` function and print the tree using `inorderTraversal`.

This is a basic implementation of BST insertion in C++. It's worth noting that there are more advanced techniques for balancing BSTs to maintain their efficiency, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Problems

Sure! Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures in computer science that provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Here are a few common problems and tasks related to binary search trees in C++:

1. **Insertion**: Implement the insertion of a node into a binary search tree.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void insert(TreeNode *&root, int val) {
    if (!root) {
        root = new TreeNode(val);
        return;
    }
    if (val < root->val) {
        insert(root->left, val);
    } else {
        insert(root->right, val);
    }
}
```

1. **Search**: Implement a function to search for a value in a BST.

```cpp
bool search(TreeNode *root, int val) {
    if (!root) return false;
    if (root->val == val) return true;
    if (val < root->val) return search(root->left, val);
    else return search(root->right, val);
}
```

1. **Deletion**: Implement the deletion of a node in a BST.

```cpp
TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr) {
        current = current->left;
    }
    return current;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}
```

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Implement inorder traversal of a BST.

```cpp
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}
```

These are some basic operations and problems related to binary search trees in C++. There are many more advanced operations and problems you can explore once you're comfortable with these fundamentals!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Pros and Cons

Binary search trees (BSTs) in C++ are a fundamental data structure used for organizing and storing data efficiently. Here are some pros and cons:

**Pros:**

1. **Efficient Searching**: BSTs provide efficient searching capabilities. On average, the time complexity for searching, inserting, and deleting elements in a balanced BST is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This makes BSTs ideal for applications where fast searching is crucial.

2. **Ordered Structure**: BSTs maintain the ordering of elements, ensuring that elements are stored in sorted order. This property makes it easier to perform operations like finding the minimum and maximum elements, finding successor/predecessor elements, and performing range queries efficiently.

3. **Flexible Structure**: BSTs allow for easy insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining the binary search tree properties. This flexibility makes BSTs suitable for dynamic applications where the data set changes frequently.

4. **Space Efficiency**: BSTs typically consume memory proportional to the number of elements stored in the tree, making them space-efficient compared to other data structures like hash tables.

**Cons:**

1. **Balancing Issues**: If not balanced properly, BSTs can degenerate into a linear data structure (essentially a linked list), leading to worst-case time complexities of O(n) for searching, inserting, and deleting elements. This can happen if the elements are inserted in sorted order.

2. **Balancing Overhead**: Maintaining balance in a BST requires additional operations during insertion and deletion, which can add overhead to these operations. Balanced BST variants like AVL trees and Red-Black trees address this issue by ensuring that the tree remains balanced, but they require additional bookkeeping and may have slightly higher overhead.

3. **Complexity**: Compared to simpler data structures like arrays and linked lists, implementing and understanding the algorithms for BSTs can be more complex, especially when dealing with balancing and traversal algorithms.

4. **Sensitive to Input**: The efficiency of BST operations can be sensitive to the input data. In the worst-case scenario, where the tree is heavily unbalanced, the time complexity of operations can degrade significantly, leading to poor performance.

Overall, binary search trees are powerful data structures with efficient searching capabilities and ordered storage properties. However, proper attention must be paid to balancing and maintenance to ensure optimal performance in all scenarios.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Search

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In C++, you can implement a BST as a class with nodes containing data, left, and right pointers. Here's a simple implementation for searching in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    // Constructor
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the BinarySearchTree class
class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function for searching
    Node* searchRecursive(Node* node, int key) {
        // Base cases: node is null or key is present at node
        if (node == nullptr || node->data == key)
            return node;

        // Key is greater than node's data, search in right subtree
        if (key > node->data)
            return searchRecursive(node->right, key);

        // Key is smaller than node's data, search in left subtree
        return searchRecursive(node->left, key);
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BinarySearchTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a new node with given data
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Helper function for insertion
    Node* insertRecursive(Node* node, int value) {
        // If the tree is empty, return a new node
        if (node == nullptr)
            return new Node(value);

        // Otherwise, recur down the tree
        if (value < node->data)
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, value);
        else if (value > node->data)
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, value);

        // return the unchanged node pointer
        return node;
    }

    // Function to search for a key in the BST
    bool search(int key) {
        Node* result = searchRecursive(root, key);
        return (result != nullptr);
    }
};

int main() {
    BinarySearchTree bst;

    // Insert some elements into the BST
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    // Search for elements
    std::cout << "Searching for 20: " << (bst.search(20) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Searching for 90: " << (bst.search(90) ? "Found" : "Not found") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a basic implementation of a binary search tree with insertion and searching capabilities. You can run this code to see how searching works in a BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Traversal

In C++, traversing a binary search tree (BST) involves visiting each node in a specific order. There are mainly three types of traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder. Here's how you can implement these traversals:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform inorder traversal of a binary search tree
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Function to perform preorder traversal of a binary search tree
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    cout << root->val << " ";
    preorderTraversal(root->left);
    preorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Function to perform postorder traversal of a binary search tree
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    postorderTraversal(root->left);
    postorderTraversal(root->right);
    cout << root->val << " ";
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the `main()` function, we create a binary search tree with some sample values. Then, we demonstrate each type of traversal by calling the corresponding traversal function (`inorderTraversal`, `preorderTraversal`, and `postorderTraversal`). These functions recursively traverse the tree in the specified order and print the node values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search trees: basics

Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures in computer science used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In C++, you can implement a binary search tree using classes and pointers. Here's a basic overview:

1. **Node Structure**: You start by defining a structure/class to represent each node in the binary search tree. Each node typically contains a value, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};
```

1. **Insertion**: To insert a new node into the binary search tree, you traverse the tree according to the value of the node to be inserted, comparing it with the values of nodes in the tree, and find the appropriate position to insert.

```cpp
Node* insert(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        Node* newNode = new Node;
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->left = nullptr;
        newNode->right = nullptr;
        return newNode;
    }

    if (value < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    } else if (value > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);
    }

    return root;
}
```

1. **Searching**: Searching in a BST is similar to insertion. You start at the root and compare the value you are searching for with the value of the current node. Based on the comparison, you move left or right in the tree until you find the node or reach a leaf node.

```cpp
bool search(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }

    if (root->data == value) {
        return true;
    } else if (value < root->data) {
        return search(root->left, value);
    } else {
        return search(root->right, value);
    }
}
```

1. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from a binary search tree is a bit more complex as it requires maintaining the binary search tree properties. There are several cases to consider, including nodes with no children, nodes with one child, and nodes with two children.

1. **Traversal**: There are different ways to traverse a binary search tree: inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal. Each traversal method has its own characteristics and use cases.

These are the basics of binary search trees in C++. Remember to handle memory management properly, especially in insertion and deletion operations, to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Big O

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the time complexity for various operations depends on the structure of the tree. Here's the Big O complexity for common operations on a Binary Search Tree implemented in C++:

1. **Insertion (Average Case):** O(log n)
   - In the average case, the time complexity for inserting a node into a BST is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in a balanced BST, each level roughly halves the number of nodes to search.

2. **Insertion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - In the worst case scenario, the tree becomes degenerate, resembling a linked list. This happens when elements are inserted in a sorted order. In this case, each node has only one child, and the height of the tree becomes equal to the number of nodes. Hence, the time complexity for insertion becomes O(n).

3. **Deletion (Average Case):** O(log n)
   - Similar to insertion, deletion in a balanced BST takes O(log n) time on average.

4. **Deletion (Worst Case):** O(n)
   - In the worst case, when the tree becomes degenerate, deletion also takes O(n) time.

5. **Searching:** O(log n)
   - Searching in a balanced BST also takes O(log n) time on average.

6. **Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder):** O(n)
   - Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversal of a BST visit every node once. Therefore, their time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Remember, these complexities are for operations on a balanced BST. If the tree is unbalanced or degenerate, the worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n) for both insertion and deletion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Breadth First Search (Breadth First Search)

In the context of binary search trees (BSTs), breadth-first search (BFS) is a traversal algorithm that visits all the nodes in the tree level by level, from left to right. This traversal approach is different from depth-first search (DFS), which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here's a basic outline of how you could implement breadth-first search on a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a BST node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform breadth-first search on a binary search tree
void BFS(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Process current node
        cout << current->data << " ";

        // Enqueue left child
        if (current->left != nullptr)
            q.push(current->left);

        // Enqueue right child
        if (current->right != nullptr)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
}

// Function to insert a node into a binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new Node(value);

    if (value < root->data)
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    else if (value > root->data)
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);

    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 8);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 1);
    root = insert(root, 6);
    root = insert(root, 9);
    root = insert(root, 14);

    // Perform breadth-first search
    cout << "Breadth-First Search: ";
    BFS(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `Node` struct represents a node in the binary search tree.
- The `BFS` function performs breadth-first search on the binary search tree using a queue to keep track of nodes at each level.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node into the binary search tree according to BST properties.
- In the `main` function, a sample binary search tree is created and then BFS is performed on it.

This implementation outputs the nodes of the binary search tree in breadth-first order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Constructor

In C++, a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure that maintains a set of keys in a sorted order. Each node in a BST has at most two child nodes: a left child and a right child. The key property of a BST is that for each node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key, and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key.

Here's how you can define a basic Binary Search Tree class in C++ with a constructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a BST node
struct TreeNode {
    int key;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    // Constructor to initialize a node with given key
    TreeNode(int value) : key(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Define the Binary Search Tree class
class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root; // Pointer to the root node of the BST
    
public:
    // Constructor to initialize an empty BST
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}
    
    // Other member functions like insertion, deletion, search, traversal, etc. can be defined here
};

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    BST bst;
    
    // Perform operations on the BST
    // ...
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` is a struct representing a node in the BST. It contains a key (an integer in this case) and pointers to its left and right children. The constructor `TreeNode(int value)` initializes a node with the given key value.

- `BST` is a class representing the Binary Search Tree. It has a private member `root` which points to the root node of the tree. The constructor `BST()` initializes an empty BST by setting the root pointer to `nullptr`.

- You can add other member functions such as insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, etc., as needed.

- In the `main()` function, you can create an instance of the `BST` class and perform operations on it.

This is a basic implementation to get you started with Binary Search Trees in C++. Feel free to expand upon it to suit your specific needs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Contains

In C++, implementing a binary search tree (BST) and the `contains` function, which checks if a value is present in the tree, involves a few steps. First, you need to define a structure for the nodes of the tree. Then, you can write a function to insert nodes into the tree and another function to check if a value exists in the tree. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a value into the binary search tree
void insert(TreeNode*& root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new TreeNode(val);
        return;
    }
    if (val < root->val) {
        insert(root->left, val);
    } else {
        insert(root->right, val);
    }
}

// Function to check if a value exists in the binary search tree
bool contains(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root->val == val) {
        return true;
    } else if (val < root->val) {
        return contains(root->left, val);
    } else {
        return contains(root->right, val);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    
    // Insert some values into the binary search tree
    insert(root, 5);
    insert(root, 3);
    insert(root, 7);
    insert(root, 1);
    insert(root, 4);
    
    // Check if values exist in the binary search tree
    std::cout << "Tree contains 3: " << (contains(root, 3) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Should print "Yes"
    std::cout << "Tree contains 6: " << (contains(root, 6) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Should print "No"
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` is a struct representing each node in the BST, containing an integer value (`val`) and pointers to the left and right children.
- The `insert` function recursively inserts a value into the tree based on the binary search tree property (values less than the current node go to the left, and values greater than or equal to the current node go to the right).
- The `contains` function recursively checks if a value exists in the tree.
- In the `main` function, some values are inserted into the tree, and then the `contains` function is called to check if certain values exist in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Convert Sorted List to Balanced Binary Search Trees

To convert a sorted list into a balanced binary search tree (BST) in C++, you can follow a recursive approach. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to convert a sorted list to a balanced BST
TreeNode* sortedListToBST(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) // Base case: no elements to construct BST
        return nullptr;

    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Find the middle element

    // Create a new tree node with the middle element
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);

    // Recursively construct left and right subtrees
    root->left = sortedListToBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
    root->right = sortedListToBST(nums, mid + 1, end);

    return root;
}

// Helper function to print the inorder traversal of a BST
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Function to convert a sorted list to a balanced BST
TreeNode* sortedListToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
    return sortedListToBST(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<int> sortedList = {-10, -3, 0, 5, 9};
    TreeNode* root = sortedListToBST(sortedList);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the constructed BST
    inorderTraversal(root);
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` is a struct representing a node in the binary tree.
- `sortedListToBST` is the main function that converts the sorted list into a balanced BST. It takes a vector of integers representing the sorted list and two indices `start` and `end` representing the range of elements to consider in the current recursive call.
- `sortedListToBST` is a helper function that initializes the recursive process by calling the main function with appropriate parameters.
- `inorderTraversal` is a helper function to print the inorder traversal of the constructed BST.
- In the `main` function, you can create a sorted list and call `sortedListToBST` to obtain the balanced BST. Then, you can print the inorder traversal of the BST to verify the correctness of the conversion.

This approach ensures that the resulting binary search tree is balanced, as the middle element of the sorted list is chosen as the root, and the left and right halves are recursively processed to construct the left and right subtrees.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Count Trees

To count the number of binary search trees (BSTs) that can be formed with a given number of nodes \( n \), you can use dynamic programming. The count of unique BSTs with \( n \) nodes can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Count}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Count}(i-1) \times \text{Count}(n-i) \]

Here, \( \text{Count}(i-1) \) represents the number of unique BSTs with \( i-1 \) nodes on the left subtree, and \( \text{Count}(n-i) \) represents the number of unique BSTs with \( n-i \) nodes on the right subtree, considering that the root node has \( i \) as its value.

Here's a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int countTrees(int n) {
    std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
            dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter the number of nodes: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << "Number of unique BSTs with " << n << " nodes: " << countTrees(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the count of unique BSTs for a given number of nodes \( n \) using dynamic programming. It iterates from 1 to \( n \), calculating the count of BSTs for each number of nodes and storing the results in the `dp` array. Finally, it returns the count for \( n \) nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search trees: delete

In C++, implementing the deletion operation for binary search trees (BSTs) involves several cases to consider. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can implement it:

1. **Find the Node to Delete**:
   - Start from the root and traverse the tree to find the node with the value to be deleted.

2. **Identify the Cases**:
   - Once the node is found, identify the following cases:
     - Node to be deleted is a leaf node (no children).
     - Node to be deleted has one child.
     - Node to be deleted has two children.

3. **Handling Each Case**:
   - **Case 1: Node is a Leaf**:
     - Simply remove the node from the tree.
   - **Case 2: Node has One Child**:
     - Replace the node with its child.
   - **Case 3: Node has Two Children**:
     - Find the node with the minimum value in the right subtree (or the maximum value in the left subtree).
     - Replace the node to be deleted with this node.
     - Delete the node with the minimum value (which has become duplicated) from its original position.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Here's a basic implementation of the delete operation in C++:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

Node* minValueNode(Node* node) {
    Node* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;
    return current;
}

Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    if (key < root->data)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->data)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        root->data = temp->data;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
    }
    return root;
}
```

This is a basic implementation and might need adjustments based on the specific requirements of your project, such as handling memory management, balancing the tree, etc. Additionally, you can add error handling to deal with cases like attempting to delete a node that doesn't exist in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Depth First Search InOrder

In a binary search tree (BST), depth-first search (DFS) with the in-order traversal visits nodes in the following order: left subtree, current node, right subtree. In C++, you can implement this traversal recursively. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Traverse the left subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);
    
    // Visit the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    
    // Traverse the right subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(12);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(20);

    // Performing in-order traversal
    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory (optional)
    // Note: In a real application, you would typically use smart pointers instead.
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure to represent nodes in the BST. The `inOrderTraversal` function performs the in-order traversal recursively. Finally, in the `main` function, a sample BST is created and its in-order traversal is performed.

Remember to handle memory management properly, either by using smart pointers or by explicitly deleting allocated memory as shown in the example.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Depth First Search PostOrder

In the context of binary search trees (BSTs), Depth First Search (DFS) is a method used to traverse the nodes of the tree. In postorder traversal, you visit the nodes in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root.

Here's how you can implement Depth First Search (DFS) PostOrder traversal for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode *root;

    // Helper function for postorder traversal
    void postorderHelper(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        // Traverse left subtree
        postorderHelper(node->left);

        // Traverse right subtree
        postorderHelper(node->right);

        // Visit root
        cout << node->val << " ";
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to perform postorder traversal
    void postorderTraversal() {
        postorderHelper(root);
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Function to insert a value into the BST
    void insert(int val) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, val);
    }

    // Helper function to recursively insert into BST
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* node, int val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }

        if (val < node->val) {
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, val);
        } else {
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, val);
        }

        return node;
    }
};

int main() {
    BST tree;
    // Inserting elements into the BST
    tree.insert(5);
    tree.insert(3);
    tree.insert(8);
    tree.insert(2);
    tree.insert(4);
    tree.insert(7);
    tree.insert(9);

    // Performing postorder traversal
    cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    tree.postorderTraversal();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary search tree (BST) class and implements postorder traversal. The `BST` class has methods for insertion and postorder traversal. The `insert` method inserts elements into the BST, and the `postorderTraversal` method performs postorder traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Depth First Search PreOrder

In the context of Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Depth First Search (DFS) PreOrder traversal is a method for visiting each node in the tree. In PreOrder traversal, you visit the root node first, then recursively visit the left subtree, and finally recursively visit the right subtree.

Here's how you can implement DFS PreOrder traversal for a Binary Search Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a BST node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    // Constructor
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform PreOrder traversal
void preOrderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) // Base case: if the tree is empty, return
        return;

    // Print the current node's data
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Recursively traverse the left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Recursively traverse the right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Function to insert a node into the BST
Node* insertNode(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) // If tree is empty, create a new node
        return new Node(value);

    if (value < root->data) // If value is less than current node, traverse left
        root->left = insertNode(root->left, value);
    else if (value > root->data) // If value is greater than current node, traverse right
        root->right = insertNode(root->right, value);

    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample BST
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insertNode(root, 10);
    insertNode(root, 5);
    insertNode(root, 15);
    insertNode(root, 3);
    insertNode(root, 7);
    insertNode(root, 12);
    insertNode(root, 18);

    // Performing PreOrder traversal
    std::cout << "PreOrder Traversal: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a BST node structure, implements the PreOrder traversal function (`preOrderTraversal`), and provides a sample `main` function to demonstrate its usage.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Example

Sure, let's walk through an example of implementing a binary search tree (BST) in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    // Constructor to initialize data, left, and right pointers
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it as the root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(val);
    }
    
    // If the value is less than the current node's value, go left
    if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value is greater than or equal to the current node's value, go right
    else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }
    
    return root;
}

// Function to search for a value in the BST
bool search(Node* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, return false
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // If the value is equal to the current node's value, return true
    if (val == root->data) {
        return true;
    }
    // If the value is less than the current node's value, search left subtree
    else if (val < root->data) {
        return search(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value is greater than the current node's value, search right subtree
    else {
        return search(root->right, val);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;
    
    // Insert some values into the BST
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    
    // Search for some values in the BST
    std::cout << "Searching for 10: " << (search(root, 10) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Searching for 20: " << (search(root, 20) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `Node` struct to represent each node in the BST. Each node contains data, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child. We also define functions `insert` to insert a new node into the BST and `search` to search for a value in the BST. Finally, in the `main` function, we create an empty BST, insert some values into it, and search for some values to demonstrate the functionality of the BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search trees: in-order traversal

In-order traversal is a fundamental operation on binary search trees (BSTs) in which you visit all the nodes of the tree in sorted order. Here's how you can perform an in-order traversal of a binary search tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform in-order traversal of a binary search tree
void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Traverse left subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Visit the current node
    std::cout << root->val << " ";

    // Traverse right subtree
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(14);
    root->left->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(13);

    // Perform in-order traversal
    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right->left;
    delete root->left->right->right;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary search tree.
- The `inOrderTraversal` function recursively traverses the BST in in-order fashion, first visiting the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST, perform the in-order traversal, and then clean up the dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.

This code will output the elements of the BST in sorted order, demonstrating the in-order traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Inorder successor and predecessor

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key. Conversely, the inorder predecessor is the node with the largest key smaller than the node's key. Here's how you can find the inorder successor and predecessor of a given node in a BST using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the inorder successor and predecessor of a BST node.
    void findPreSuc(TreeNode* root, TreeNode*& pre, TreeNode*& suc, int key) {
        if (!root) return;

        // If key matches the root's key.
        if (root->val == key) {
            // Inorder predecessor is the maximum value in the left subtree.
            if (root->left) {
                TreeNode* tmp = root->left;
                while (tmp->right)
                    tmp = tmp->right;
                pre = tmp;
            }
            // Inorder successor is the minimum value in the right subtree.
            if (root->right) {
                TreeNode* tmp = root->right;
                while (tmp->left)
                    tmp = tmp->left;
                suc = tmp;
            }
            return;
        }

        // If key is smaller than root's key, search in the left subtree.
        if (root->val > key) {
            suc = root;
            findPreSuc(root->left, pre, suc, key);
        }
        // If key is larger than root's key, search in the right subtree.
        else {
            pre = root;
            findPreSuc(root->right, pre, suc, key);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Create a BST.
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    TreeNode* pre = nullptr;
    TreeNode* suc = nullptr;
    int key = 35;

    // Find the inorder successor and predecessor.
    solution.findPreSuc(root, pre, suc, key);

    // Print the inorder successor and predecessor.
    if (pre)
        std::cout << "Predecessor: " << pre->val << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "No predecessor." << std::endl;

    if (suc)
        std::cout << "Successor: " << suc->val << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "No successor." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure and a `Solution` class with a method `findPreSuc` to find the predecessor and successor of a given key in the BST. In the `main` function, a sample BST is created, and then the `findPreSuc` function is called to find the predecessor and successor of a given key. Finally, the predecessor and successor values are printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Insert

Certainly! In C++, inserting into a binary search tree (BST) involves traversing the tree to find the appropriate position for the new node based on the key value. Here's a basic implementation of the insert operation for a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int key;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new key into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node as the root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(key);
    }
    
    // Traverse the tree to find the appropriate position for the new node
    if (key < root->key) {
        // Insert into the left subtree if key is less than current node's key
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        // Insert into the right subtree if key is greater than current node's key
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }
    
    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST (for testing)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->key << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert some keys into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Print the inorder traversal to verify the BST structure
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to insert elements into a binary search tree in C++. The `insert` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and the key to be inserted. It recursively traverses the tree based on the key value, inserting the new node into the appropriate position.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Invert Binary Tree

Inverting a binary tree is a fundamental operation on binary trees where the left and right subtrees of each node are swapped. Here's how you can implement the invert operation for a binary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    // Swap left and right subtrees
    TreeNode* temp = root->left;
    root->left = root->right;
    root->right = temp;
    
    // Recursively invert left and right subtrees
    invertTree(root->left);
    invertTree(root->right);
}

// Function to print the tree in inorder traversal (for testing)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);

    std::cout << "Before inverting: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    invertTree(root);

    std::cout << "After inverting: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory (not necessary for demonstration)
    // Cleanup(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing each node in the binary tree. The `invertTree` function recursively inverts the left and right subtrees of each node. The `main` function demonstrates the usage by creating a binary tree, inverting it, and printing the result before and after inversion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Is Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are commonly used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They are a type of binary tree where each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.

In a BST, for every node:

1. All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
2. All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

This property allows for efficient searching, as it enables a binary search algorithm to rapidly find a particular value within the tree.

BST operations:

1. **Insertion**: To insert a new value into a BST, you start at the root and compare the value to be inserted with the current node's value. If it's less, you move to the left subtree; if it's greater, you move to the right subtree. You continue this process recursively until you find an empty spot, where you insert the new node.

2. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from a BST involves three cases:
   - If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove it from the tree.
   - If the node to be deleted has one child, replace it with its child.
   - If the node to be deleted has two children, find the node with the next highest value (successor) in the right subtree (or the next lowest value - predecessor - in the left subtree), replace the node to be deleted with the successor, and then delete the successor node.

3. **Search**: Searching in a BST is similar to insertion. You start at the root and compare the value you're searching for with the current node's value. If they match, you've found the node. If the value is less, you move to the left subtree; if it's greater, you move to the right subtree. You continue this process recursively until you find the node or reach a leaf node indicating the value isn't present.

BSTs have average-case time complexities of O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search operations, but in the worst-case scenario (e.g., if the tree is unbalanced), these operations can degrade to O(n). Techniques such as balancing algorithms (like AVL trees or Red-Black trees) can mitigate this issue, ensuring that the tree remains relatively balanced and maintaining efficient performance.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Kth Smallest Node

To find the Kth smallest node in a binary search tree (BST), you can perform an in-order traversal of the BST. In an in-order traversal, you visit nodes in non-decreasing order, which is the property of a BST. While traversing, keep track of the count of visited nodes, and when the count reaches K, return the value of the current node.

Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int result = -1;
        inorderTraversal(root, k, count, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root, int k, int& count, int& result) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;
        
        // Traverse left subtree
        inorderTraversal(root->left, k, count, result);
        
        // Process current node
        count++;
        if (count == k) {
            result = root->val;
            return;
        }
        
        // Traverse right subtree
        inorderTraversal(root->right, k, count, result);
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    // Construct a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    Solution solution;
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << "The " << k << "th smallest element is: " << solution.kthSmallest(root, k) << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory (not necessary in practice if using smart pointers)
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output the Kth smallest element in the binary search tree. In the example provided, it will output the 3rd smallest element. Make sure you construct your BST accordingly or modify the tree construction part to fit your BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Level Order Traversal

Level order traversal, also known as breadth-first traversal, is a method for traversing trees where you visit all the nodes at each level before moving to the next level. Implementing level order traversal for a binary search tree (BST) in C++ involves using a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a node in the BST
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform level order traversal of a BST
void levelOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Create a queue to store nodes
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        // Get the front node of the queue
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        cout << current->data << " ";

        // Remove the front node from the queue
        q.pop();

        // Enqueue the left child if it exists
        if (current->left != nullptr)
            q.push(current->left);

        // Enqueue the right child if it exists
        if (current->right != nullptr)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
}

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new TreeNode(val);

    if (val < root->data)
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    else if (val > root->data)
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);

    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample BST
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Perform level order traversal
    cout << "Level Order Traversal: ";
    levelOrderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a structure `TreeNode` to represent nodes in the binary search tree.
- `levelOrderTraversal` function takes the root node of the BST as input and performs level order traversal.
- We use a `queue` to keep track of nodes at each level. We start with the root node and enqueue its children (if any). Then, we dequeue the front node and repeat the process until the queue is empty.
- `insert` function is used to insert nodes into the BST.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST and then perform level order traversal on it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Print Range

Printing elements within a specific range in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves traversing the tree while checking if each node's value falls within the given range. Here's a C++ implementation of printing all elements in a given range `[low, high]` in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    // Function to print nodes within a given range
    void printRange(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (!root) return;

        // If current node's value is within the range, print it
        if (root->val >= low && root->val <= high) {
            std::cout << root->val << " ";
        }

        // If the current node's value is greater than the low, then only we can move left
        if (root->val > low) {
            printRange(root->left, low, high);
        }

        // If the current node's value is smaller than the high, then only we can move right
        if (root->val < high) {
            printRange(root->right, low, high);
        }
    }
};

// Utility function to create a new BST node
TreeNode* newNode(int item) {
    TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(item);
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    BST bst;

    /* Constructed binary search tree is:
                10
               /  \
              5   50
             /   / \
            1   40  100 */

    TreeNode* root = newNode(10);
    root->left = newNode(5);
    root->right = newNode(50);
    root->left->left = newNode(1);
    root->right->left = newNode(40);
    root->right->right = newNode(100);

    int low = 5, high = 40;
    std::cout << "Nodes within range [" << low << ", " << high << "] are: ";
    bst.printRange(root, low, high);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program will output:

```bash
Nodes within range [5, 40] are: 10 5 40
```

The `printRange` function checks if the current node's value lies within the given range `[low, high]`. If it does, it prints the value. Then, it recursively checks the left subtree if the current node's value is greater than `low`, and the right subtree if the current node's value is less than `high`. This ensures that all nodes within the specified range are printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search trees: running times

Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to efficiently store and retrieve sorted data. The running times of various operations on binary search trees depend on the height of the tree and whether the tree is balanced or not.

Here are the running times for common operations on binary search trees:

1. **Search**: Searching for an element in a binary search tree has a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced binary search tree (e.g., AVL tree, Red-Black tree), the height is typically O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. However, in the worst-case scenario, when the tree is unbalanced (e.g., if elements are inserted in sorted order), the height can be O(n), making the search operation O(n) in the worst case.

2. **Insertion**: Inserting an element into a binary search tree involves searching for the appropriate position for the new element and adding it as a leaf node. The time complexity of insertion is also O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced tree, insertion takes O(log n) time on average, but it can take O(n) time in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.

3. **Deletion**: Deleting an element from a binary search tree requires locating the node containing the element and then adjusting the tree structure accordingly. Like insertion and search, the time complexity of deletion is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced tree, deletion typically takes O(log n) time on average, but it can take O(n) time in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.

4. **Traversal**: There are several ways to traverse a binary search tree, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal. Each traversal visits every node in the tree once. The time complexity of traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as every node is visited once.

5. **Minimum and Maximum**: Finding the minimum (leftmost) or maximum (rightmost) element in a binary search tree can be done by following the left (for minimum) or right (for maximum) child pointers from the root until reaching a leaf node. In a balanced tree, this operation takes O(log n) time, but it can take O(n) time in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.

6. **Successor and Predecessor**: Finding the successor (smallest element greater than the given element) or predecessor (largest element smaller than the given element) of a given node involves navigating through the tree. In a balanced tree, this operation takes O(log n) time, but it can take O(n) time in the worst case for an unbalanced tree.

Efficient implementations of binary search trees typically involve self-balancing techniques like AVL trees or Red-Black trees to ensure that the height of the tree remains logarithmic, keeping the running times of operations within the desired bounds.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary search trees: search, insert

Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science used for organizing and searching data efficiently. In a binary search tree, each node has at most two child nodes, and the left child node contains a value less than its parent node, while the right child node contains a value greater than its parent node. This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Here's how you can implement search and insert operations for a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a binary search tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to search for a value in the binary search tree
TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int value) {
    // Base cases: root is null or root's value matches the search value
    if (root == nullptr || root->data == value) {
        return root;
    }

    // If the value is less than root's value, search in the left subtree
    if (value < root->data) {
        return search(root->left, value);
    }
    // If the value is greater than root's value, search in the right subtree
    else {
        return search(root->right, value);
    }
}

// Function to insert a value into the binary search tree
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int value) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it as the new root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(value);
    }

    // If the value is less than the root's value, insert into the left subtree
    if (value < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    }
    // If the value is greater than the root's value, insert into the right subtree
    else if (value > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);
    }

    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of the binary search tree
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert some values into the binary search tree
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the binary search tree
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Search for a value in the binary search tree
    int valueToSearch = 40;
    TreeNode* result = search(root, valueToSearch);
    if (result != nullptr) {
        std::cout << valueToSearch << " found in the BST." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << valueToSearch << " not found in the BST." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides implementations for search and insert operations on a binary search tree. The `search` function recursively searches for a given value in the BST, while the `insert` function recursively inserts a new node with the given value into the BST. Additionally, a `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions by creating a binary search tree, inserting some values into it, and searching for a specific value.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Solving Contains

Certainly! Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, known for their efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Let's dive into implementing the `contains` function in C++ for a Binary Search Tree.

First, let's define the structure of a node in the BST:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

Now, let's implement the `contains` function which checks whether a given value exists in the BST:

```cpp
bool contains(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false; // Tree is empty
    }

    if (root->val == val) {
        return true; // Value found at the root
    } else if (val < root->val) {
        return contains(root->left, val); // Search in the left subtree
    } else {
        return contains(root->right, val); // Search in the right subtree
    }
}
```

This function recursively searches the BST for the given value `val`. If the current node is `nullptr`, it means the value is not found in the subtree rooted at this node, so it returns `false`. If the value is found at the current node, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it recursively searches in the left subtree if `val` is less than the current node's value, or in the right subtree if `val` is greater than the current node's value.

Here's a sample usage of this function:

```cpp
int main() {
    // Constructing a sample BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(12);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Check if value exists in the BST
    int value = 7;
    if (contains(root, value)) {
        cout << "BST contains " << value << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "BST does not contain " << value << endl;
    }

    // Deallocate memory (optional)
    // Your deallocation code here...

    return 0;
}
```

This program will output "BST contains 7" because the value 7 exists in the BST. You can modify the `value` variable to test for different values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Validate Binary Search Trees

Validating a binary search tree (BST) in C++ involves ensuring that for every node, the values of all the nodes in its left subtree are less than its value, and the values of all the nodes in its right subtree are greater than its value. Here's a simple implementation to validate a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }

    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
        if (!root) return true;

        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal)
            return false;

        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Solution sol;

    // Creating a BST
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    // Validating the BST
    if (sol.isValidBST(root))
        cout << "The given binary tree is a valid binary search tree." << endl;
    else
        cout << "The given binary tree is not a valid binary search tree." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `isValidBST` function is a public function which is a wrapper function for the actual recursive function `isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal)`.
- The recursive function checks whether the current node's value is within the specified range (which gets updated during the traversal) and calls itself recursively for the left and right subtrees, updating the range accordingly.
- The `LONG_MIN` and `LONG_MAX` are used as initial lower and upper bounds for the root node.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees Deletion

Sure, in C++, deletion in binary search trees (BSTs) involves several cases depending on the node being deleted. Here's a basic outline of how you might implement deletion in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the minimum value node in a given BST
Node* minValueNode(Node* node) {
    Node* current = node;
    // Loop down to find the leftmost leaf
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;
    return current;
}

// Function to perform deletion in a BST
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    // Base case: if the tree is empty
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree
    if (key < root->data)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);

    // If the key to be deleted is greater than the root's key, then it lies in the right subtree
    else if (key > root->data)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);

    // If key is same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->data = temp->data;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to insert a new node with the given key
Node* insert(Node* node, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, return a new node
    if (node == nullptr) return new Node(key);

    // Otherwise, recur down the tree
    if (key < node->data)
        node->left = insert(node->left, key);
    else if (key > node->data)
        node->right = insert(node->right, key);

    // Return the unchanged node pointer
    return node;
}

// Function to perform inorder traversal of the BST
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->data << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the original tree:\n";
    inorder(root);

    root = deleteNode(root, 20);
    std::cout << "\nInorder traversal after deletion of 20:\n";
    inorder(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation handles cases where the node to be deleted has zero, one, or two children. You can extend it to handle more complex scenarios like deleting nodes with two children, balancing the tree after deletion, etc., depending on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Binary Search Trees: Minimum Value, Maximum Depth And Mirror

Sure! Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science. Let's go through how to find the minimum value, the maximum depth, and how to create a mirror image of a BST in C++.

#### Minimum Value in a Binary Search Tree

To find the minimum value in a binary search tree, you need to traverse the left child of each node until you reach a node with no left child. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int findMin(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Tree is empty!" << std::endl;
        return -1; // Return some sentinel value indicating an error
    }
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }
    return root->val;
}
```

#### Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree

To find the maximum depth of a binary tree (BST or not), you can use recursive depth-first search (DFS) traversal and keep track of the depth of each node. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return 0;
    }
    int leftDepth = maxDepth(root->left);
    int rightDepth = maxDepth(root->right);
    return std::max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
}
```

#### Creating a Mirror Image of a Binary Search Tree

To create a mirror image of a binary search tree, you need to swap the left and right children of each node recursively. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
void mirror(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    // Swap left and right children
    TreeNode* temp = root->left;
    root->left = root->right;
    root->right = temp;
    // Recursively mirror left and right subtrees
    mirror(root->left);
    mirror(root->right);
}
```

You can call these functions by creating a binary search tree and passing its root to these functions. Remember, these are just basic implementations. Depending on your requirements, you might need to handle edge cases differently, such as empty trees or trees with only one node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of Balanced Binary Search Trees

Balanced binary search trees are essential data structures that maintain their balanced structure during insertions and deletions, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Here are some commonly used types of balanced binary search trees:

1. **AVL Trees**: Named after their inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis, AVL trees are one of the earliest forms of self-balancing binary search trees. In AVL trees, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Rotations are performed to maintain this balance upon insertion and deletion operations.

2. **Red-Black Trees**: Red-black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree. They maintain balance using a set of constraints including coloring nodes either red or black and performing rotations. Red-black trees guarantee that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice the length of the shortest path.

3. **Splay Trees**: Unlike AVL and red-black trees, splay trees do not maintain a rigid balance criterion. Instead, they rely on a property called "splayability" where frequently accessed nodes move closer to the root. This property helps in amortizing the cost of operations and achieving good average-case performance.

4. **Treaps (Randomized Binary Search Trees)**: Treaps combine the properties of binary search trees and heaps. Each node has two keys: one for the binary search tree property and one for the heap property. The keys are typically chosen randomly, which results in an expected height of O(log n).

5. **Weight-Balanced Trees**: These trees maintain balance based on the weights of the subtrees rather than their heights. Weight-balanced trees aim to keep the sizes of subtrees roughly equal, ensuring efficient balancing operations.

6. **B-Trees**: While not strictly binary search trees, B-trees are balanced multiway search trees commonly used in databases and file systems. They maintain balance by ensuring that all leaf nodes are at the same level and by performing splitting and merging operations as needed.

These are some of the most common types of balanced binary search trees, each with its own advantages and use cases. The choice of which type to use depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the frequency and type of operations performed and memory constraints.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Closest in Binary Search Trees

To find the closest value in a binary search tree (BST) to a given target value in C++, you can perform a modified binary search traversal. Here's a step-by-step algorithm:

1. Start with the root node.
2. Traverse the tree, moving left or right based on the comparison of the current node's value with the target value.
3. Keep track of the closest node value encountered so far.
4. Update the closest node value if a closer one is found during traversal.
5. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.

Here's a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int closestValue(TreeNode* root, double target) {
        int closest = root->val;
        double min_diff = std::abs(static_cast<double>(root->val) - target);

        TreeNode* current = root;
        while (current) {
            double diff = std::abs(static_cast<double>(current->val) - target);
            if (diff < min_diff) {
                min_diff = diff;
                closest = current->val;
            }
            
            if (current->val == target) {
                return current->val;
            } else if (current->val < target) {
                current = current->right;
            } else {
                current = current->left;
            }
        }
        
        return closest;
    }
};

// Test the implementation
int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    double target = 3.714286; // Example target value
    int closest = solution.closestValue(root, target);
    std::cout << "Closest value to " << target << " is: " << closest << std::endl;

    // Remember to free memory to avoid memory leaks
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure and a `Solution` class with a `closestValue` function to find the closest value to the target value in the given BST. In the `main` function, a simple test case is provided to demonstrate the usage of the `closestValue` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Convert Binary Search Trees to Sorted Singly List

Certainly! Converting a Binary Search Tree (BST) to a sorted singly linked list is a common problem in algorithms and data structures. The idea is to perform an in-order traversal of the BST, which gives the nodes in sorted order. During this traversal, we adjust the pointers to convert the binary tree into a singly linked list.

Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* convertBSTtoLinkedList(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

        TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
        TreeNode* head = nullptr;

        convert(root, prev, head);

        return head;
    }

private:
    void convert(TreeNode* root, TreeNode*& prev, TreeNode*& head) {
        if (root == nullptr) return;

        convert(root->left, prev, head);

        if (prev == nullptr) {
            head = root;
        } else {
            prev->right = root;
        }

        root->left = nullptr;
        prev = root;

        convert(root->right, prev, head);
    }
};

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(TreeNode* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        std::cout << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->right;
    }
    std::cout << "nullptr" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* head = solution.convertBSTtoLinkedList(root);

    std::cout << "Sorted Singly Linked List: ";
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure `TreeNode` and a class `Solution` with a method `convertBSTtoLinkedList` that converts the BST to a sorted singly linked list. The `convert` method does an in-order traversal of the BST, updating the pointers to convert it into a linked list. Finally, in the `main` function, an example BST is created, converted to a linked list, and then printed out.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Create a Binary Search Tree

Sure, here's a simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node class representing each node in the binary search tree
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    // Constructor
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// BinarySearchTree class
class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function to insert a value into the BST
    Node* insertHelper(Node* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new Node(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertHelper(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertHelper(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Helper function to perform inorder traversal recursively
    void inorderTraversalHelper(Node* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inorderTraversalHelper(node->left);
            cout << node->data << " ";
            inorderTraversalHelper(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Function to insert a value into the BST
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertHelper(root, value);
    }

    // Function to perform inorder traversal of the BST
    void inorderTraversal() {
        inorderTraversalHelper(root);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BinarySearchTree bst;

    // Insert some values into the BST
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the BST
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    bst.inorderTraversal();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` class representing each node in the binary search tree and a `BinarySearchTree` class that implements the binary search tree operations like insertion and inorder traversal. In the `main` function, some values are inserted into the BST, and then the inorder traversal of the BST is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Drawbacks of Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) offer efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations in certain scenarios, but they also come with some drawbacks:

1. **Unbalanced Trees**: The primary drawback of BSTs is their susceptibility to becoming unbalanced, leading to performance degradation. If elements are inserted in sorted order, or in a specific order that doesn't allow the tree to balance itself, the tree may degenerate into a linked list. This can lead to worst-case time complexities for operations, reducing the benefits of using a tree structure.

2. **Complexity of Balancing**: Although self-balancing BSTs like AVL trees and Red-Black trees exist to mitigate the problem of unbalanced trees, they come with additional complexity. Implementing and maintaining these trees requires more overhead in terms of code complexity and memory usage.

3. **Space Overhead**: Each node in a binary search tree typically requires additional memory for storing pointers to its left and right children. This overhead can be significant when storing large amounts of data, especially if the tree becomes unbalanced and requires additional nodes to be created.

4. **Sensitive to Input Order**: The performance of BST operations can be highly dependent on the order in which elements are inserted or deleted. In scenarios where the input data is not uniformly distributed or is already sorted, the tree may become unbalanced, leading to suboptimal performance.

5. **No O(1) Operations**: Unlike hash tables, which offer O(1) average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations, the performance of BST operations is logarithmic (O(log n)) in the average case and can degrade to linear time (O(n)) in the worst case for unbalanced trees.

6. **Limited Operations**: While BSTs excel at searching, insertion, and deletion, they do not support certain operations efficiently, such as range queries or finding the closest element to a given value. These operations may require additional traversal or modifications to the tree structure, resulting in increased time complexity.

7. **Sensitive to Malicious Input**: In certain scenarios, an adversary may intentionally craft input data to exploit the weaknesses of BSTs, causing worst-case performance scenarios such as degenerate trees or denial of service attacks.

Despite these drawbacks, BSTs remain a fundamental data structure with widespread use due to their simplicity, versatility, and efficiency in many common scenarios. However, in situations where these drawbacks become significant, alternative data structures such as balanced trees, hash tables, or specialized data structures may be preferred.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Find Max in Binary Search Trees

Certainly! In C++, you can find the maximum value in a binary search tree (BST) by traversing to the rightmost node because, in a BST, the rightmost node always holds the maximum value. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the maximum value in a BST
int findMax(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return -1; // Return -1 if tree is empty

    // Traverse to the rightmost node
    while (root->right != nullptr) {
        root = root->right;
    }

    // Return the data of the rightmost node, which is the maximum value
    return root->data;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(25);

    // Find the maximum value in the binary search tree
    int maxVal = findMax(root);
    std::cout << "Maximum value in the BST: " << maxVal << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct for the nodes of the binary search tree and implements the `findMax` function to traverse to the rightmost node and return its value. Finally, it demonstrates the usage of this function in the `main` function with a sample binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Find Min in Binary Search Trees

In C++, finding the minimum value in a binary search tree (BST) is a straightforward task. Here's an example implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node definition for the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the minimum value in a BST
int findMin(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Tree is empty!\n";
        return -1; // Return a sentinel value to indicate error
    }

    // Keep going left until reaching the leftmost node
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }

    // Now, root points to the leftmost node which has the minimum value
    return root->data;
}

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }

    if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }

    return root;
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 10);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 5);
    insert(root, 15);

    // Find the minimum value
    int minVal = findMin(root);
    if (minVal != -1) {
        std::cout << "Minimum value in the BST: " << minVal << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the BST.
- The `findMin` function takes the root of the BST as input and traverses the left child of each node until it reaches a node without a left child. That node will have the minimum value.
- The `insert` function is used to insert new nodes into the BST.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST and then call `findMin` to find the minimum value in it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Graphs: Exercise: In-order Successor in Binary Search Trees - LeetCode 285

LeetCode 285, the "In-order Successor in Binary Search Trees" problem, tasks you with finding the in-order successor of a given node in a Binary Search Tree (BST). Here's a breakdown of the problem and a possible approach to solving it:

#### Problem Description

Given a BST and a node, find the in-order successor of that node. The in-order successor of a node in a BST is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key. If the given node has no in-order successor, return `nullptr`.

#### Example

```bash
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the in-order traversal of the BST is [1,2,3]. The node with value 1 has an in-order successor with value 2.
```

#### Approach

1. If the given node has a right child, then the successor lies in the right subtree of that node. Traverse the right subtree to find the leftmost node, which will be the in-order successor.
2. If the given node doesn't have a right child, then you need to backtrack to find the successor. Start from the root and traverse the tree:
   - If the current node is smaller than the given node, move to its right child.
   - If the current node is greater than or equal to the given node, move to its left child.

#### Implementation (C++)

Here's a C++ implementation of the approach described above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* inorderSuccessor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p) {
        TreeNode* successor = nullptr;
        while (root != nullptr) {
            if (root->val > p->val) {
                successor = root;
                root = root->left;
            } else {
                root = root->right;
            }
        }
        return successor;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    TreeNode* p = root->left;
    TreeNode* successor = sol.inorderSuccessor(root, p);
    if (successor != nullptr)
        std::cout << "In-order successor: " << successor->val << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "No in-order successor found." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(H), where H is the height of the BST. In the worst case, where the tree is skewed, the time complexity can be O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Creating a Binary Search Tree

Sure, I can guide you through creating a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, and the key (value) in each node is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree.

Let's start by defining the structure of a node in C++:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    // Constructor
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

Now, let's create the BinarySearchTree class which will contain methods to insert, search, and traverse the tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Private helper functions
    Node* insertRecursive(Node* root, int value);
    bool searchRecursive(Node* root, int value);
    void inOrderTraversal(Node* root);

public:
    // Constructor
    BinarySearchTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Public methods
    void insert(int value);
    bool search(int value);
    void inOrderTraversal();
};
```

Here, we have defined three private helper functions for insertion, searching, and traversal. Let's implement these methods:

```cpp
// Insertion recursively
Node* BinarySearchTree::insertRecursive(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        root = new Node(value);
    } else if (value <= root->data) {
        root->left = insertRecursive(root->left, value);
    } else {
        root->right = insertRecursive(root->right, value);
    }
    return root;
}

void BinarySearchTree::insert(int value) {
    root = insertRecursive(root, value);
}

// Searching recursively
bool BinarySearchTree::searchRecursive(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    } else if (root->data == value) {
        return true;
    } else if (value < root->data) {
        return searchRecursive(root->left, value);
    } else {
        return searchRecursive(root->right, value);
    }
}

bool BinarySearchTree::search(int value) {
    return searchRecursive(root, value);
}

// In-order traversal recursively
void BinarySearchTree::inOrderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inOrderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->data << " ";
        inOrderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

void BinarySearchTree::inOrderTraversal() {
    inOrderTraversal(root);
}
```

Now, you can use this BinarySearchTree class to create a binary search tree, insert elements into it, search for elements, and traverse it in an in-order manner.

Here's a simple usage example:

```cpp
int main() {
    BinarySearchTree bst;

    // Insert elements
    bst.insert(50);
    bst.insert(30);
    bst.insert(20);
    bst.insert(40);
    bst.insert(70);
    bst.insert(60);
    bst.insert(80);

    // Search for an element
    cout << "Is 40 present in the BST? " << (bst.search(40) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    // In-order traversal
    cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    bst.inOrderTraversal();
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```bash
Is 40 present in the BST? Yes
In-order traversal: 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
```

This is a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree in C++. There are more operations you can add, like deletion, pre-order and post-order traversals, etc., but this should give you a good starting point.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science, particularly for organizing and searching data efficiently. It is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a BST is that for each node:

1. All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
2. All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Here's a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Insert a key into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key);
    }

    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }

    return root;
}

// Search for a key in the BST
bool search(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }

    if (root->key == key) {
        return true;
    } else if (key < root->key) {
        return search(root->left, key);
    } else {
        return search(root->right, key);
    }
}

// Inorder traversal of the BST (prints nodes in sorted order)
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->key << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    root = insert(root, 30);
    root = insert(root, 20);
    root = insert(root, 40);
    root = insert(root, 70);
    root = insert(root, 60);
    root = insert(root, 80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    int keyToSearch = 70;
    if (search(root, keyToSearch)) {
        cout << keyToSearch << " found in the BST." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << keyToSearch << " not found in the BST." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a simple BST with integer keys and provides functions for insertion, search, and inorder traversal. You can extend this implementation with additional functionality such as deletion, preorder, and postorder traversals, balancing operations like AVL or Red-Black trees, etc., depending on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Performance and Problem of Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science known for their efficient searching capabilities. However, despite their advantages, they also come with some performance issues and problems that need to be addressed.

#### Performance

1. **Search Time Complexity**: The average and best-case time complexity of searching in a binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in a balanced binary search tree, each comparison reduces the search space by half. However, in the worst-case scenario, when the tree is unbalanced (essentially forming a linked list), the search time complexity becomes O(n), making it as inefficient as linear search.

2. **Insertion and Deletion Time Complexity**: Similar to searching, the average time complexity for insertion and deletion operations in a balanced BST is O(log n). However, in the case of an unbalanced tree, these operations can degrade to O(n) time complexity, making them inefficient.

3. **Space Complexity**: Binary search trees have a space complexity of O(n) since they store each node individually. This can be a concern when dealing with large datasets, as it requires a significant amount of memory.

#### Problems

1. **Unbalanced Trees**: The main problem with binary search trees is that they can become unbalanced during insertion and deletion operations. An unbalanced tree can degrade the performance of search, insertion, and deletion operations from O(log n) to O(n), essentially rendering the advantages of a binary search tree moot.

2. **Degenerate Trees**: If elements are inserted in sorted order into a binary search tree, it can result in a degenerate tree, essentially forming a linked list. This scenario leads to worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **Solution Dependency**: There are solutions to address the unbalanced tree issue, such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and Splay trees. However, each solution has its trade-offs in terms of space complexity, insertion, deletion, and search performance.

4. **Complexity of Operations**: While the average-case time complexity of operations in a balanced BST is efficient, the worst-case time complexity can be problematic in real-world scenarios where the tree might not remain balanced due to dynamic data insertion and deletion.

To mitigate these problems, it's important to choose the appropriate balancing strategy based on the application requirements. Additionally, self-balancing trees like AVL trees or Red-Black trees can be used to ensure that the tree remains balanced, thereby maintaining efficient performance for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Trees

Sure, converting a sorted array into a binary search tree (BST) is a common problem in computer science. Here's a simple C++ implementation using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return nullptr;

    // Find middle element of the array
    int mid = nums.size() / 2;

    // Create new node with the middle element
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);

    // Recursively build left and right subtrees
    vector<int> leftNums(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + mid);
    vector<int> rightNums(nums.begin() + mid + 1, nums.end());

    root->left = sortedArrayToBST(leftNums);
    root->right = sortedArrayToBST(rightNums);

    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST (for verification)
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<int> nums = {-10, -3, 0, 5, 9};
    TreeNode* root = sortedArrayToBST(nums);

    // Print inorder traversal of the constructed BST
    inorder(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code will convert a sorted array `nums` into a balanced BST. The `sortedArrayToBST` function takes a vector of integers as input and returns the root of the constructed BST. It recursively divides the input array into two halves and constructs the left and right subtrees accordingly. The `inorder` function is just for verification purposes to print the inorder traversal of the constructed BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Delete a node from Binary Search Trees

In C++, you can delete a node from a binary search tree (BST) by following these steps:

1. Find the node to delete.
2. If the node has no children, simply remove it.
3. If the node has one child, replace it with its child.
4. If the node has two children, find its in-order successor (the smallest node in its right subtree), replace the node's value with the value of the in-order successor, and then delete the in-order successor.

Here's the C++ code implementing these steps:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr) {
        node = node->left;
    }
    return node;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;
    
    // Search for the node to delete
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        // Node to delete found
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        
        // Node to delete has two children
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);

    cout << "Binary Search Tree before deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 3;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    cout << "Binary Search Tree after deletion of node with value " << key << ": ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up
    // This part is not necessary in actual implementation, just for demonstration
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements the deletion of a node from a binary search tree in C++. It includes the definition of a `TreeNode` struct representing each node in the tree, a function to find the minimum value node in a subtree (`findMin`), and the main deletion function (`deleteNode`). Finally, there is a `main` function demonstrating the usage of the `deleteNode` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Deletion in Binary Search Tree

Sure, deletion in a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental operation. It's a bit more complex than insertion due to various cases you need to consider. Here's a basic outline of the algorithm to delete a node from a BST in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr) {
        node = node->left;
    }
    return node;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 3);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and provides functions for finding the minimum value in a subtree (`findMin`) and deleting a node from the BST (`deleteNode`). The `main` function demonstrates the usage by creating a BST, deleting a node, and printing the inorder traversal before and after deletion.

The `deleteNode` function handles the three cases of node deletion:

1. Node to be deleted has no children.
2. Node to be deleted has one child.
3. Node to be deleted has two children.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Deleting from Binary Search Tree

In C++, deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves several cases to consider:

1. **Node to be deleted has no children (leaf node)**: In this case, simply remove the node from the tree.
2. **Node to be deleted has one child**: Replace the node to be deleted with its child.
3. **Node to be deleted has two children**: Find the node's in-order successor (the node with the smallest key in its right subtree), replace the node's value with the value of its in-order successor, and then delete the in-order successor node.

Here's a C++ implementation for deleting a node from a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Helper function to find minimum value node in a BST
Node* minValueNode(Node* node) {
    Node* current = node;

    // Loop down to find the leftmost leaf
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;

    return current;
}

// Helper function to perform BST deletion
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    // Base case: If the tree is empty
    if (root == nullptr)
        return root;

    // Recur down the tree
    if (key < root->key)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->key)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        Node* temp = minValueNode(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->key = temp->key;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->key);
    }
    return root;
}

// Helper function to perform in-order traversal of BST
void inorder(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->key << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = new Node(50);
    root->left = new Node(30);
    root->right = new Node(70);
    root->left->left = new Node(20);
    root->left->right = new Node(40);
    root->right->left = new Node(60);
    root->right->right = new Node(80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int key_to_delete = 30;
    root = deleteNode(root, key_to_delete);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key_to_delete << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program demonstrates how to delete a node from a BST using the three cases mentioned above. You can modify it according to your needs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Delete entire Binary Search Trees

Deleting an entire Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ involves recursively deleting each node in the tree. Here's a basic outline of how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    Node* root;

    void deleteSubtree(Node* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;
        
        deleteSubtree(node->left);
        deleteSubtree(node->right);
        delete node;
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    ~BST() {
        deleteSubtree(root);
    }

    // Other member functions for insertion, search, traversal, etc.
};

int main() {
    BST tree;
    // Code to build and use the BST
    // Make sure tree is properly constructed and used

    // Delete the entire tree when done
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` represents each node in the BST.
- `BST` is the Binary Search Tree class which has a pointer to the root node.
- The `deleteSubtree` function recursively deletes each node in the tree starting from the given node.
- The destructor `~BST()` calls `deleteSubtree` to delete the entire tree when the BST object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

Ensure you don't have any dangling pointers or memory leaks while deleting nodes, especially in more complex scenarios like handling parent pointers or implementing balancing algorithms.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Delete Operation in Binary Search Tree

Certainly! In C++, the deletion operation in a binary search tree (BST) involves several cases to handle:

1. If the node to be deleted is a leaf node.
2. If the node to be deleted has only one child.
3. If the node to be deleted has two children.

Here's a basic implementation of the deletion operation in a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr)
        node = node->left;
    return node;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // Traverse the tree to find the node to be deleted
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 3;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation performs the deletion operation while maintaining the properties of a binary search tree. Make sure to test it with different cases to ensure its correctness.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Determine Whether a Binary tree is Skewed Binary Search Trees or Not

To determine whether a binary tree is a skewed binary search tree (BST) or not, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check for BST Property**: Verify if the given binary tree is a binary search tree. In a BST, for each node, all elements in its left subtree are smaller than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater.

2. **Check for Skewed Structure**: After confirming it's a BST, examine the structure to see if it's skewed. A skewed binary tree is a special case of a binary tree where every node except one has only one child.

Here's a C++ implementation to determine whether a binary tree is a skewed BST or not:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Binary Tree Node Definition
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST)
bool isBST(TreeNode* root, int minVal, int maxVal) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return true;

    if (root->val < minVal || root->val > maxVal)
        return false;

    return isBST(root->left, minVal, root->val - 1) &&
           isBST(root->right, root->val + 1, maxVal);
}

// Function to check if a binary tree is skewed or not
bool isSkewedBST(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) // Empty tree is considered skewed
        return true;
    
    if (!isBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)) // Not a BST
        return false;

    // Check if all nodes have either zero or one child
    while (root->left || root->right) {
        if (root->left && root->right)
            return false;
        root = root->left ? root->left : root->right;
    }
    return true;
}

// Utility function to create a new tree node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(val);
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    /* Example usage */
    TreeNode* root = newNode(5);
    root->left = newNode(3);
    root->right = newNode(6);
    root->left->left = newNode(2);
    root->left->right = newNode(4);
    root->left->left->left = newNode(1);

    if (isSkewedBST(root))
        cout << "The binary tree is a skewed binary search tree.\n";
    else
        cout << "The binary tree is not a skewed binary search tree.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code first checks if the binary tree is a BST using the `isBST` function, then checks if the tree is skewed by verifying if each node has either zero or one child.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How do you find the minimum in a Binary Search Tree?

To find the minimum value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) implemented in C++, you can traverse the left child pointers of the nodes until you reach the leftmost leaf node. This leftmost leaf node will contain the minimum value in the BST. Here's how you can implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    // Function to find the minimum value in the BST
    int findMin(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            throw std::invalid_argument("BST is empty");
        
        // Traverse left until we reach the leftmost leaf
        while (root->left != nullptr) {
            root = root->left;
        }
        
        return root->val;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    BST bst;
    
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);
    
    // Finding the minimum value
    try {
        int minVal = bst.findMin(root);
        std::cout << "Minimum value in the BST: " << minVal << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::invalid_argument& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a BST class with a `findMin` function that takes the root of the BST as input and returns the minimum value in the tree. The `findMin` function traverses the left child pointers of the nodes until it reaches the leftmost leaf node. If the BST is empty, it throws an exception.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is a binary search tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure used for organizing data in a hierarchical manner. It is composed of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a binary search tree is that for every node:

1. All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
2. All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

This property makes binary search trees efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting elements, as it enables a binary search algorithm to quickly locate elements within the tree.

In C++, a binary search tree can be implemented using a structure or a class to represent the nodes, with pointers to the left and right children, and functions to perform operations like insertion, deletion, and searching while maintaining the BST property.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is a Binary Search Tree? Why do we need it?

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure in computer science, particularly in the realm of algorithm design and analysis. It is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Additionally, for every node in the tree:

1. All elements in the left subtree are less than the node's value.
2. All elements in the right subtree are greater than the node's value.

This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Here's why we need BSTs:

1. **Efficient Search**: Due to the ordering property of BSTs, searching for a specific value can be done in O(log n) time complexity on average, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because at each step of the search, we can discard half of the remaining nodes.

2. **Ordered Operations**: BSTs maintain elements in sorted order. This property is useful for various applications where we need to process elements in sorted order efficiently.

3. **Insertion and Deletion**: BSTs allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining the BST property. On average, these operations also take O(log n) time complexity.

4. **Balanced Binary Search Trees**: While the basic BST provides efficient operations, it can become inefficient if it becomes unbalanced (e.g., resembling a linked list). Balanced binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees ensure that the tree remains balanced, thus guaranteeing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations in worst-case scenarios.

5. **Binary Search Trees are Versatile**: They can be used to implement various other data structures and algorithms, such as sets, maps, priority queues, and more.

Overall, Binary Search Trees are essential data structures because they offer efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, and their versatility makes them applicable in a wide range of algorithmic problems.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Minmum Height Binary Search Trees

A minimum height binary search tree (BST) is a binary search tree where the height of the tree is minimized while still maintaining the properties of a binary search tree. This means that for any node in the tree, the height of its left and right subtrees should not differ by more than 1, and the left subtree should contain values less than the node's value, while the right subtree should contain values greater than the node's value.

Here's a basic approach to constructing a minimum height binary search tree in C++:

1. **Sort the input array**: Since the tree needs to be balanced, sorting the array will help in selecting the middle element as the root, ensuring the tree is balanced.

2. **Recursively construct the tree**: Recursively divide the sorted array into two halves. The middle element of each half becomes a node in the tree. Repeat this process for each half until all elements are added to the tree.

Here's a sample C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to construct a minimum height BST from a sorted array
TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) return nullptr;

    // Get the middle element and make it the root
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);

    // Recursively construct the left and right subtrees
    root->left = sortedArrayToBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
    root->right = sortedArrayToBST(nums, mid + 1, end);

    return root;
}

// Utility function to print the inorder traversal of a BST
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

    // Construct the BST
    TreeNode* root = sortedArrayToBST(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the constructed BST
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed BST:\n";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation constructs a minimum height binary search tree from a sorted array of integers and prints its inorder traversal. You can modify it as per your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Generating Binary Search Trees from Preorder

Generating a Binary Search Tree (BST) from a preorder traversal involves utilizing the property of preorder traversal where the first element is always the root. Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to construct BST from preorder traversal
TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder, int& index, int minValue, int maxValue) {
    // Base case
    if (index == preorder.size())
        return nullptr;
    
    int val = preorder[index];
    
    // If the current value is not in the range [minValue, maxValue], return null
    if (val < minValue || val > maxValue)
        return nullptr;
    
    // Create a new node with the current value
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(val);
    
    // Increment index to process the next element in the preorder traversal
    index++;
    
    // Recursively construct left and right subtrees
    root->left = bstFromPreorder(preorder, index, minValue, val);
    root->right = bstFromPreorder(preorder, index, val, maxValue);
    
    return root;
}

// Helper function to initialize construction of BST from preorder
TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
    int index = 0; // Start index for preorder traversal
    return bstFromPreorder(preorder, index, INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST (for verification)
void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> preorder = {8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12};
    
    // Construct BST from preorder traversal
    TreeNode* root = bstFromPreorder(preorder);
    
    // Print inorder traversal of constructed BST
    cout << "Inorder Traversal of BST: ";
    printInorder(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct representing a node in the binary tree, and two functions: `bstFromPreorder` and `printInorder`. The `bstFromPreorder` function constructs a binary search tree from a given preorder traversal vector. The `printInorder` function prints the inorder traversal of the constructed BST.

The main function demonstrates the usage by creating a preorder traversal vector and then constructing a BST from it, followed by printing its inorder traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Google Trees question: Kth Smallest Element In a Binary Search Trees

To find the kth smallest element in a binary search tree (BST), you can use an in-order traversal. In a BST, an in-order traversal visits the nodes in non-decreasing order, which means the kth node visited will be the kth smallest element.

Here's a C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
    stack<TreeNode*> s;
    TreeNode* curr = root;
    int count = 0;
    
    while (curr != nullptr || !s.empty()) {
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            s.push(curr);
            curr = curr->left;
        }
        
        curr = s.top();
        s.pop();
        count++;
        
        if (count == k)
            return curr->val;
        
        curr = curr->right;
    }
    
    return -1; // If k is greater than the number of nodes in the BST
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(1);

    int k = 3;
    cout << "The " << k << "th smallest element is: " << kthSmallest(root, k) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct representing the nodes in the binary tree. The `kthSmallest` function takes the root of the BST and the value of k as input parameters and returns the kth smallest element. It uses a stack to perform an iterative in-order traversal until it reaches the kth smallest element.

Make sure to free the allocated memory for the tree nodes after you're done using them to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How do you insert into a Binary Search Tree?

Inserting into a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves finding the correct position for the new node based on its key value and then adding it as a leaf node. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to insert a new node into a Binary Search Tree using C++:

1. **Create a Node structure:** First, define a structure for the nodes in the BST. Each node should contain at least a key value, pointers to its left and right children (if any), and possibly other data fields as needed.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int key;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : key(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

1. **Define the insertion function:** Create a function to insert a new key into the BST. This function will take the root of the tree and the key to be inserted as parameters.

```cpp
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and make it the root
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(key);
    }

    // If the key is less than the root's key, go to the left subtree
    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    }
    // If the key is greater than the root's key, go to the right subtree
    else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }

    // Return the (unchanged) root pointer
    return root;
}
```

1. **Call the insertion function:** Finally, call the `insert` function with the root of the BST and the key you want to insert.

```cpp
int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Inserting elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    root = insert(root, 30);
    root = insert(root, 20);
    root = insert(root, 40);
    root = insert(root, 70);
    root = insert(root, 60);
    root = insert(root, 80);

    return 0;
}
```

This code will create a Binary Search Tree with the given keys. Each new key is inserted into the appropriate position in the tree according to the BST property, which states that for any node in the tree, its left child's key is less than its own key, and its right child's key is greater than its own key.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How does delete work in a Binary Search Tree?

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the `delete` operation removes a node while maintaining the BST properties. The procedure depends on various cases:

1. **Deleting a leaf node (no children):** In this case, you simply remove the node from the tree.

2. **Deleting a node with one child:** If the node to be deleted has only one child, you can replace the node with its child.

3. **Deleting a node with two children:** This is the most complex case. You need to find the node's in-order successor or predecessor. The in-order successor is the smallest node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted, and the in-order predecessor is the largest node in the left subtree. Once you find the successor/predecessor, you replace the node to be deleted with it, and then delete the successor/predecessor from its original position.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in the delete operation:

1. Start from the root and traverse the tree to find the node to be deleted.
2. If the node is found:
   - If it's a leaf or has only one child, handle it accordingly.
   - If it has two children, find its in-order successor or predecessor.
3. Replace the node to be deleted with its successor/predecessor.
4. Delete the successor/predecessor from its original position (as it has been moved).
5. Adjust the tree as necessary to maintain the BST properties.

Here's a simplified implementation in C++:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr) {
        node = node->left;
    }
    return node;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;
    
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}
```

This code deletes a node with the given `key` from the BST and returns the root of the modified tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inorder and Search in Binary Search Tree

Certainly! In C++, implementing the inorder traversal and search operations in a binary search tree (BST) involves recursive techniques. Let's start with the BST structure and then implement the inorder traversal and search functions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) : key(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a key into the BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new Node(key);

    if (key < root->key)
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->key)
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);

    return root;
}

// Inorder traversal of the BST
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->key << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Search for a key in the BST
bool search(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return false;

    if (root->key == key)
        return true;
    else if (key < root->key)
        return search(root->left, key);
    else
        return search(root->right, key);
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 50);
    root = insert(root, 30);
    root = insert(root, 20);
    root = insert(root, 40);
    root = insert(root, 70);
    root = insert(root, 60);
    root = insert(root, 80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    int searchKey = 60;
    if (search(root, searchKey))
        std::cout << searchKey << " found in the BST." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << searchKey << " not found in the BST." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Node` structure to represent each node in the BST. It contains an integer key and pointers to the left and right child nodes.
- The `insert` function inserts a new key into the BST.
- The `inorderTraversal` function recursively traverses the BST in inorder and prints the keys.
- The `search` function recursively searches for a key in the BST and returns true if found, otherwise false.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample BST and demonstrate the inorder traversal and search functionalities.

This code provides a basic implementation of inorder traversal and search in a BST using C++. Feel free to modify and expand it according to your requirements!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How to Validate a Binary Search Tree

Validating a binary search tree (BST) in C++ typically involves checking if the tree satisfies the BST property: for every node, its value should be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree. Here's a recursive approach to validate a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool isValidBSTHelper(TreeNode* root, long long minVal, long long maxVal) {
    if (!root) return true;
    
    if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal) return false;
    
    return isValidBSTHelper(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBSTHelper(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
}

bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
    return isValidBSTHelper(root, LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    
    std::cout << (isValidBST(root) ? "Valid BST" : "Not a valid BST") << std::endl;
    
    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. `isValidBSTHelper` is a recursive function that traverses the tree. It takes three parameters: the current node, the minimum value it can have, and the maximum value it can have.
2. We start by checking if the current node is null. If it is, we return true (an empty tree is a valid BST).
3. Then we check if the current node's value violates the BST property. If it does, we return false.
4. We recursively call `isValidBSTHelper` for the left and right subtrees, updating the minimum and maximum values accordingly. For the left subtree, the maximum value becomes the current node's value, and for the right subtree, the minimum value becomes the current node's value.
5. Finally, `isValidBST` is a wrapper function that calls `isValidBSTHelper` with the root node and the minimum and maximum possible values (`LLONG_MIN` and `LLONG_MAX`).

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since it visits each node once.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inorder Successor in Binary Search Trees

In a binary search tree (BST), the inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the node's key. To find the inorder successor in a BST, you can follow these steps:

1. If the right subtree of the node is not NULL, then the successor lies in the right subtree. So, you go to the right child of the node and then keep moving to the left child until you reach the leaf node, which will be the inorder successor.
2. If the right subtree is NULL, then the successor is one of the ancestors. You go up the tree from the given node until you encounter a node which is a left child of its parent. The parent of this node will be the inorder successor.

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int value) : key(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

Node* findMin(Node* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr)
        node = node->left;
    return node;
}

Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* root, Node* target) {
    if (target->right != nullptr)
        return findMin(target->right);

    Node* successor = nullptr;
    while (root != nullptr) {
        if (target->key < root->key) {
            successor = root;
            root = root->left;
        } else if (target->key > root->key) {
            root = root->right;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return successor;
}

int main() {
    Node* root = new Node(20);
    root->left = new Node(10);
    root->right = new Node(30);
    root->left->right = new Node(15);
    root->right->left = new Node(25);

    Node* successor = inorderSuccessor(root, root->left);
    if (successor != nullptr)
        std::cout << "Inorder successor of " << root->left->key << " is " << successor->key << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "No inorder successor found" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a simple binary search tree and finds the inorder successor of a given node. It prints the key of the inorder successor.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Additional Learning - Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

Learning about binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs) is a great way to deepen your understanding of algorithms and data structures in C++. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
   - The topmost node of the tree is called the root. From there, each node can have either zero, one, or two children nodes.
   - Binary trees can be used to efficiently represent hierarchical data such as expressions, file systems, or decision trees.
   - There are various types of binary trees, including full binary trees, complete binary trees, perfect binary trees, and balanced binary trees.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A binary search tree is a special type of binary tree in which the left child of a node contains a value less than the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value.
   - This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, as it maintains the order of elements.
   - BSTs are often used in applications where efficient searching is required, such as in databases and in implementing associative arrays or sets.
   - However, if not balanced properly, BSTs can degenerate into linked lists, resulting in inefficient operations. This is where balanced binary trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees come into play.

When learning about binary trees and BSTs in C++, it's essential to understand how to implement operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal (e.g., in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal). You'll also want to familiarize yourself with key concepts like tree height, depth, and balance.

Practicing coding exercises and implementing these data structures from scratch is highly recommended to solidify your understanding. Additionally, you can explore various libraries and frameworks that provide implementations of these data structures, such as the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) or other third-party libraries.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Insert a node to Binary Search Trees

Sure! Below is a C++ implementation to insert a node into a binary search tree (BST). In a BST, each node has a key value, and the left child of a node has a key less than its parent, while the right child has a key greater than its parent.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node with a given key into a BST
TreeNode* insertNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, return a new node
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new TreeNode(key);

    // Otherwise, recur down the tree
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = insertNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = insertNode(root->right, key);

    // return the (unchanged) node pointer
    return root;
}

// Function to do an inorder traversal of a BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insertNode(root, 50);
    insertNode(root, 30);
    insertNode(root, 20);
    insertNode(root, 40);
    insertNode(root, 70);
    insertNode(root, 60);
    insertNode(root, 80);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to insert nodes into a BST and performs an inorder traversal to print the elements of the tree in sorted order. You can modify it according to your needs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Insert Operation in Binary Search Tre

Certainly! In C++, the insert operation in a binary search tree (BST) involves finding the correct position for the new node based on its value and then inserting it into the tree. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure for a node in the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and make it the root
    if (root == NULL) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }
    
    // If the value is less than the current node's value, go left
    if (val < root->val) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    }
    // If the value is greater than or equal to the current node's value, go right
    else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }
    
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Creating an empty binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = NULL;
    
    // Inserting elements into the binary search tree
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);
    
    // Print the inorder traversal of the BST (should print sorted order)
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a binary search tree and inserts elements into it using the `insert` function. The `inorderTraversal` function is then used to print the elements of the BST in sorted order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inserting in a Binary Search Tree

Sure! Inserting a node into a binary search tree (BST) involves finding the appropriate position for the new node based on its value and then adding it to the tree. Here's how you can implement the insertion operation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    // Constructor
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int value) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(value);
    }
    
    // If the value is less than the root's value, insert into the left subtree
    if (value < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    }
    // If the value is greater than the root's value, insert into the right subtree
    else if (value > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);
    }
    
    // Return the root node
    return root;
}

// Function to perform inorder traversal of the binary search tree
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->data << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating an empty binary search tree
    Node* root = nullptr;
    
    // Inserting elements into the binary search tree
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    
    // Performing inorder traversal to display the elements of the binary search tree
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary search tree: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a structure for a node in the binary search tree and provides functions for insertion and inorder traversal of the tree. You can call the `insert` function to insert new nodes into the tree, and the `inorderTraversal` function to display the elements of the tree in sorted order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Insertion in Binary Search Tree

Sure, let's discuss how insertion works in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++.

A BST is a binary tree where each node has at most two children, and for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

Here's a basic structure for a Node in C++:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

And here's how you can implement the insertion function:

```cpp
Node* insert(Node* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
        return new Node(val);
    }

    // Otherwise, recur down the tree
    if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    } else if (val > root->data) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }

    // return the unchanged node pointer
    return root;
}
```

Here's how the insertion works:

1. If the tree is empty, create a new node with the given value and return it.
2. Otherwise, recursively search for the appropriate position to insert the new node:
   - If the value is less than the current node's value, move to the left subtree.
   - If the value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right subtree.
3. Repeat the process until you find an appropriate spot (a leaf node with a null child pointer), then insert the new node there.

You can use this function like this:

```cpp
Node* root = nullptr;
root = insert(root, 50);
root = insert(root, 30);
root = insert(root, 20);
root = insert(root, 40);
root = insert(root, 70);
root = insert(root, 60);
root = insert(root, 80);
```

This will create a BST with the following structure:

```bash
        50
       /  \
     30    70
    / \    / \
  20  40  60  80
```

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): IsBST

Sure, here's an implementation of the IsBST (Is Binary Search Tree) algorithm in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }

private:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long long minVal, long long maxVal) {
        if (root == nullptr) return true;
        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal) return false;
        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

// Helper function to create a new tree node
TreeNode* newNode(int data) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(data);
    node->left = nullptr;
    node->right = nullptr;
    return node;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Solution sol;
    
    TreeNode* root = newNode(2);
    root->left = newNode(1);
    root->right = newNode(3);

    if (sol.isValidBST(root))
        std::cout << "It is a valid BST." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "It is not a valid BST." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses the idea of recursively checking if the current node's value falls within a range (`minVal`, `maxVal`). The range for the left child of any node is the current `minVal` to the node's value, and the range for the right child is the node's value to the current `maxVal`. If at any point during the traversal, the current node's value falls outside of this range, it's not a valid BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Kth Smallest Element in a Binary Search Trees

To find the Kth smallest element in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++, you can perform an in-order traversal of the BST, which visits the nodes in sorted order. While doing the traversal, you keep track of the count of visited nodes. When the count reaches K, you return the value of the current node.

Here's the C++ code for the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int result = -1;
        kthSmallestUtil(root, k, count, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    void kthSmallestUtil(TreeNode* root, int k, int &count, int &result) {
        if (root == NULL) return;
        
        // Traverse left subtree
        kthSmallestUtil(root->left, k, count, result);
        
        // Process current node
        count++;
        if (count == k) {
            result = root->val;
            return;
        }
        
        // Traverse right subtree
        kthSmallestUtil(root->right, k, count, result);
    }
};

// Function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int data) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(data);
    return node;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(5);
    root->left = newNode(3);
    root->right = newNode(7);
    root->left->left = newNode(2);
    root->left->right = newNode(4);
    root->right->left = newNode(6);
    root->right->right = newNode(8);
    
    Solution solution;
    int k = 3;
    cout << "The " << k << "th smallest element is: " << solution.kthSmallest(root, k) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing nodes of the binary tree and a `Solution` class containing the `kthSmallest` method to find the Kth smallest element. The `main` function creates a sample BST and demonstrates the usage of the `kthSmallest` method.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Kth Smallest Element In Binary Search Trees

To find the Kth smallest element in a binary search tree (BST) using C++, you can perform an in-order traversal of the BST, which will visit the nodes in sorted order. While doing the traversal, keep track of the count of visited nodes. When the count reaches K, return the current node's value. Below is the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int result = 0;
        kthSmallestUtil(root, k, count, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    void kthSmallestUtil(TreeNode* root, int k, int& count, int& result) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;
        
        // Traverse left subtree
        kthSmallestUtil(root->left, k, count, result);
        
        // Process current node
        count++;
        if (count == k) {
            result = root->val;
            return;
        }
        
        // Traverse right subtree
        kthSmallestUtil(root->right, k, count, result);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    
    Solution sol;
    int k = 1; // Find the smallest element
    cout << "The " << k << "th smallest element is: " << sol.kthSmallest(root, k) << endl;
    
    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure and a `Solution` class containing the `kthSmallest` function. In the `main` function, it demonstrates how to use the `kthSmallest` function to find the Kth smallest element in a BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Minimum Height Binary Search Trees

To implement a minimum height binary search tree (BST) in C++, you need to understand the concept of balancing. The goal is to keep the height of the tree as small as possible, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. One popular algorithm for constructing a minimum height BST is the sorted array to BST algorithm.

Here's a simple implementation of the algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        return sortedArrayToBST(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);
    }
    
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end)
            return NULL;

        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root->left = sortedArrayToBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
        root->right = sortedArrayToBST(nums, mid + 1, end);
        return root;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the tree inorder
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    TreeNode* root = solution.sortedArrayToBST(nums);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of constructed BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the binary search tree.
- The `sortedArrayToBST` function is a recursive function that takes a sorted array of integers and constructs a balanced BST from it. It selects the middle element of the array as the root of the tree and recursively constructs the left and right subtrees from the left and right halves of the array, respectively.
- The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `sortedArrayToBST` function to construct a BST from a sorted array and then prints the inorder traversal of the constructed BST to verify its correctness.

This implementation ensures that the height of the resulting BST is minimized, providing efficient search operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Range Sum in Binary Search Trees

To implement range sum queries in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++, you can utilize the properties of BSTs to efficiently traverse and compute the sum of values within a given range. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to insert a node into BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == NULL) return new TreeNode(val);
    if (val < root->val)
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    else if (val > root->val)
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    return root;
}

// Function to perform an inorder traversal and compute range sum
void rangeSumBSTHelper(TreeNode* root, int L, int R, int& sum) {
    if (root == NULL) return;
    
    if (root->val >= L && root->val <= R) {
        sum += root->val;
        rangeSumBSTHelper(root->left, L, R, sum);
        rangeSumBSTHelper(root->right, L, R, sum);
    } else if (root->val < L) {
        rangeSumBSTHelper(root->right, L, R, sum);
    } else {
        rangeSumBSTHelper(root->left, L, R, sum);
    }
}

// Function to compute the range sum in BST
int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int L, int R) {
    int sum = 0;
    rangeSumBSTHelper(root, L, R, sum);
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Create a BST
    TreeNode* root = NULL;
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 3);
    root = insert(root, 7);
    root = insert(root, 18);

    // Define the range
    int L = 7, R = 15;

    // Compute range sum
    int sum = rangeSumBST(root, L, R);
    cout << "Sum of values in the range [" << L << ", " << R << "] is: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` struct defines the structure of each node in the BST.
- The `insert` function is used to insert nodes into the BST.
- The `rangeSumBSTHelper` function is a recursive helper function to compute the range sum.
- The `rangeSumBST` function is the main function that initializes the sum and calls the helper function.
- Finally, in the `main` function, a BST is created, a range is defined, and the range sum is computed and printed.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST, as it visits each node once. However, in average and best cases, the time complexity is O(log N) for balanced BSTs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Range Sum of Binary Search Trees

To calculate the range sum of values in a Binary Search Tree (BST) within a given range `[low, high]`, you can perform a depth-first traversal of the tree while keeping track of the sum of nodes within the specified range. Here's how you can implement this algorithm in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int sum = 0;
        if (root->val >= low && root->val <= high) {
            sum += root->val;
        }
        if (root->val > low) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root->left, low, high);
        }
        if (root->val < high) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root->right, low, high);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

// Helper function to create a binary tree
TreeNode* createTree() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);
    return root;
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* root = createTree();
    int low = 7;
    int high = 15;
    cout << "Range sum: " << solution.rangeSumBST(root, low, high) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing a node in the BST and a `Solution` class containing the `rangeSumBST` function. The `rangeSumBST` function calculates the sum of values within the specified range `[low, high]` by recursively traversing the tree. Finally, in the `main` function, a sample BST is created, and the range sum within `[low, high]` is computed and printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Binary Search Trees

Recursive Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In C++, you can implement a BST recursively using classes. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for BST
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Class for Binary Search Tree
class BST {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper function to insert a value recursively
    Node* insertRecursive(Node* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return new Node(value);
        }

        if (value < root->data) {
            root->left = insertRecursive(root->left, value);
        } else if (value > root->data) {
            root->right = insertRecursive(root->right, value);
        }

        return root;
    }

    // Helper function to perform recursive search
    bool searchRecursive(Node* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (root->data == value) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < root->data) {
            return searchRecursive(root->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchRecursive(root->right, value);
        }
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a value
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Function to search for a value
    bool search(int value) {
        return searchRecursive(root, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;

    // Insert some values
    bst.insert(10);
    bst.insert(5);
    bst.insert(15);
    bst.insert(2);
    bst.insert(7);
    
    // Search for values
    cout << "Is 5 in the tree? " << (bst.search(5) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Is 8 in the tree? " << (bst.search(8) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `Node` struct to represent each node in the BST.
- The `BST` class contains a pointer to the root node and functions for insertion and search.
- The `insertRecursive` function inserts a value recursively based on the value's comparison with the current node.
- The `searchRecursive` function searches for a value recursively.
- In the `main` function, we demonstrate inserting values into the BST and performing searches.

This is a basic implementation. You can extend it further by adding functions for deletion, traversal, balancing, and more advanced operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Binary Search Trees: Contains

Recursive binary search tree algorithms are fascinating! The "Contains" function, also known as "search" or "find", checks if a value exists within the binary search tree. In C++, you can implement it recursively like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Recursive function to search for a value in the binary search tree
bool contains(Node* root, int value) {
    // Base case: if the root is null, the tree is empty, so return false
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // If the value is found at the root, return true
    if (root->data == value) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // If the value is less than the root's data, search in the left subtree
    else if (value < root->data) {
        return contains(root->left, value);
    }
    
    // If the value is greater than the root's data, search in the right subtree
    else {
        return contains(root->right, value);
    }
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    // Construct a binary search tree
    Node* root = new Node(10);
    root->left = new Node(5);
    root->right = new Node(15);
    root->left->left = new Node(3);
    root->left->right = new Node(7);
    
    // Check if the tree contains certain values
    std::cout << "Does the tree contain 7? " << (contains(root, 7) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Output: Yes
    std::cout << "Does the tree contain 12? " << (contains(root, 12) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl; // Output: No
    
    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use recursion to implement the "contains" function for a binary search tree in C++. It recursively searches the left or right subtree based on the value being searched for, until it finds the value or reaches a null node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Binary Search Trees: Delete

Sure, I can provide you with an example of how to implement the deletion operation in a binary search tree (BST) using recursion in C++.

Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* root) {
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }
    return root;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else {
            TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
            root->val = temp->val;
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
        }
    }
    return root;
}

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 3);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree.
2. `findMin` function is used to find the minimum node in the right subtree of a given node.
3. `deleteNode` function deletes the node with the specified key value from the BST.
4. `inorderTraversal` function is used to print the elements of the BST in sorted order.
5. In the `main` function, a sample BST is created, and then the deletion operation is performed. Finally, the BST is traversed in inorder to verify the deletion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Binary Search Trees: Insert

Certainly! Binary search trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure used in computer science to efficiently store and retrieve data in a sorted order. Let's dive into the recursive implementation of inserting a new node into a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) : key(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node with a given key into a BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    // Base case: if the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key);
    }

    // Recursive case: insert the key into the appropriate subtree
    if (key < root->key) {
        // If key is less than the root's key, insert it into the left subtree
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        // If key is greater than the root's key, insert it into the right subtree
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }

    // Return the unchanged node pointer
    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of the BST
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->key << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;

    // Insert elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the BST
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the structure of a node in the BST, which contains a key value, and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `insert` function takes a pointer to the root of the BST and a key value to be inserted. It recursively inserts the key into the appropriate subtree according to the BST property.
- In the `main` function, we create an empty BST and insert some elements into it.
- Finally, we print the inorder traversal of the BST to verify that the elements are inserted in sorted order.

This is a basic recursive implementation of inserting into a binary search tree. It ensures that the BST property is maintained after each insertion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Binary Search Trees: Minimum Value

Sure, let's delve into implementing a recursive function to find the minimum value in a binary search tree (BST) using C++.

In a binary search tree, the minimum value will always be found in the leftmost node because of the property that smaller values are stored in the left subtree of any node.

Here's how you can implement the recursive function to find the minimum value:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure for a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the binary search tree
Node* insert(Node* root, int value) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(value);
    }
    if (value < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, value);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, value);
    }
    return root;
}

// Recursive function to find the minimum value in a binary search tree
int findMin(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Tree is empty\n";
        return -1; // or any appropriate handling
    }
    if (root->left == nullptr) {
        return root->data;
    }
    return findMin(root->left);
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary search tree
    Node* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 10);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 5);
    insert(root, 15);
    insert(root, 25);
    insert(root, 35);

    // Find the minimum value
    int min = findMin(root);
    std::cout << "Minimum value in the binary search tree: " << min << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Node` struct to represent each node in the binary search tree. Each node contains an integer `data` value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
- The `insert` function is used to insert a new node into the binary search tree following the rules of a BST.
- The `findMin` function recursively traverses the left child nodes until it reaches the leftmost node, which contains the minimum value.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample binary search tree and then call the `findMin` function to find the minimum value in the tree.

This code demonstrates a simple implementation of finding the minimum value in a binary search tree using recursion in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Insert and Delete on Binary Search Trees

Sure, I can provide you with examples of recursive insert and delete operations on binary search trees (BSTs) implemented in C++.

Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a node in the binary search tree
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a key into a BST
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key);
    }

    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to find the node with the minimum key in a BST
Node* findMin(Node* root) {
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to delete a key from a BST
Node* deleteNode(Node* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return root;
    }

    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        Node* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->key = temp->key;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->key);
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to print the inorder traversal of a BST
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->key << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = nullptr;

    // Inserting elements into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    insert(root, 30);
    insert(root, 20);
    insert(root, 40);
    insert(root, 70);
    insert(root, 60);
    insert(root, 80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Deleting elements from the BST
    root = deleteNode(root, 20);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting 20: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 30);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting 30: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    root = deleteNode(root, 50);
    cout << "Inorder traversal after deleting 50: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides implementations for recursive insert and delete operations on a binary search tree. The `insert` function recursively inserts a new key into the BST while maintaining the binary search tree property. The `deleteNode` function recursively deletes a key from the BST while also maintaining the BST property. Additionally, it handles cases where the node to be deleted has zero, one, or two children. Finally, the `inorderTraversal` function is used to print the elements of the BST in sorted order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Recursive Insert in Binary Search Tree

Certainly! Below is an example of how you can implement recursive insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in the BST
struct Node {
    int key;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int k) : key(k), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new key in the BST recursively
Node* insert(Node* root, int key) {
    // If the tree is empty, create a new node and return it
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new Node(key);
    }

    // Otherwise, recursively insert in the left or right subtree
    if (key < root->key) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->key) {
        root->right = insert(root->right, key);
    }

    // Return the root of the modified tree
    return root;
}

// Function to perform inorder traversal of the BST
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->key << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating an empty BST
    Node* root = nullptr;

    // Inserting keys into the BST
    root = insert(root, 50);
    root = insert(root, 30);
    root = insert(root, 20);
    root = insert(root, 40);
    root = insert(root, 70);
    root = insert(root, 60);
    root = insert(root, 80);

    // Printing inorder traversal of the BST
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` struct represents a node in the BST with a key value, left, and right child pointers.
- `insert` function inserts a new key into the BST recursively. It compares the key with the current node's key and traverses left or right accordingly until finding an appropriate spot for insertion.
- `inorderTraversal` function performs an inorder traversal of the BST, printing out the keys in sorted order.
- In the `main` function, we create an empty BST, insert some keys into it, and then print out the inorder traversal result.

You can run this code to see how the insertion works in a BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red Black Trees

Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They were invented in 1972 by Rudolf Bayer and further developed by Edward McCreight. Red-black trees maintain balance by enforcing five properties:

1. **Node Color**: Each node is either red or black.
2. **Root Property**: The root is black.
3. **Red Property**: Red nodes can't have red children.
4. **Black Depth Property**: All paths from any given node to its descendant leaves must have the same number of black nodes.
5. **Leaf Property**: Every leaf (nil node) is black.

These properties ensure that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This guarantees a balance that is logarithmic in height, which is crucial for maintaining efficient tree operations.

In C++, a red-black tree can be implemented using classes for nodes and the tree itself. Each node typically holds a key, pointers to its left and right children, a parent pointer, and a color indicator.

Here's a simple outline of the C++ implementation for a red-black tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Color { RED, BLACK };

struct Node {
    int data;
    Color color;
    Node *left, *right, *parent;

    Node(int data) : data(data), color(RED), left(nullptr), right(nullptr), parent(nullptr) {}
};

class RedBlackTree {
private:
    Node *root;

    // Helper functions
    void rotateLeft(Node *&);
    void rotateRight(Node *&);
    void fixInsertRBTree(Node *&);
    void fixDeleteRBTree(Node *&);
    void inorderHelper(Node *);
    Node* successor(Node *);

public:
    RedBlackTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Basic operations
    void insert(const int &);
    void remove(const int &);
    void inorder();
};
```

This code is a basic framework. The `insert`, `remove`, and `inorder` functions need to be implemented along with their helper functions to ensure that the red-black tree properties are maintained during insertion and deletion operations.

The `rotateLeft`, `rotateRight`, `fixInsertRBTree`, and `fixDeleteRBTree` functions are responsible for maintaining the balance and ensuring that the red-black tree properties are not violated after insertion and deletion operations.

Would you like a deeper dive into any of these functions?

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Tree creation

Creating a Red-Black Tree in C++ involves implementing the insertion and deletion operations while maintaining the properties of a Red-Black Tree. Here's a basic implementation for inserting elements into a Red-Black Tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Color { RED, BLACK };

struct Node {
    int data;
    Color color;
    Node *left, *right, *parent;

    // Constructor
    Node(int data) : data(data) {
        parent = left = right = nullptr;
        // New nodes are always red to start with
        color = RED;
    }
};

class RedBlackTree {
private:
    Node *root;

    // Function to perform left rotation
    void leftRotate(Node *x) {
        Node *y = x->right;
        x->right = y->left;
        if (y->left != nullptr)
            y->left->parent = x;
        y->parent = x->parent;
        if (x->parent == nullptr)
            root = y;
        else if (x == x->parent->left)
            x->parent->left = y;
        else
            x->parent->right = y;
        y->left = x;
        x->parent = y;
    }

    // Function to perform right rotation
    void rightRotate(Node *y) {
        Node *x = y->left;
        y->left = x->right;
        if (x->right != nullptr)
            x->right->parent = y;
        x->parent = y->parent;
        if (y->parent == nullptr)
            root = x;
        else if (y == y->parent->left)
            y->parent->left = x;
        else
            y->parent->right = x;
        x->right = y;
        y->parent = x;
    }

    // Function to fix the violation after inserting a node
    void fixViolation(Node *z) {
        while (z != root && z->parent->color == RED) {

                        leftRotate(z);
                    }
                    z->parent->color = BLACK;
                    z->parent->parent->color = RED;
                    rightRotate(z->parent->parent);
                }
            } else {
                Node *y = z->parent->parent->left;
                if (y != nullptr && y->color == RED) {

        fixViolation(z);

};

int main() {
    RedBlackTree tree;

    tree.insert(10);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(30);

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation covers the basic structure and insertion of nodes into a Red-Black Tree. You may need to extend it to support other operations like deletion and searching based on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Tree Deletion Cases

In Red-Black Tree deletion, there are several cases to consider to maintain the properties of the Red-Black Tree. Here's a summary of the cases:

1. **Node with No Children (Leaf Node):** In this case, simply remove the node and color it black if it's already black. This doesn't violate any Red-Black Tree properties.

2. **Node with One Child:** If the node to be deleted has one child, simply replace the node with its child and color the child black if the deleted node was black. If the deleted node was red, replacing it with its black child doesn't violate the properties. If the child is red, coloring it black still maintains the black height property.

3. **Node with Two Children:** This is the trickiest case. If the node to be deleted has two children, we find the successor (either the minimum node in its right subtree or the maximum node in its left subtree). We then copy the value of the successor node to the node to be deleted and delete the successor node instead (it can be either a leaf or a node with one child). This reduces the problem to either deleting a node with one child or a leaf node.

4. **Deletion of a Black Node:** After deletion, if the deleted node was black, it might violate the Red-Black Tree properties, particularly the black height property and the red-black balance property. To restore these properties, several cases might arise:

   a. **Sibling is Red:** If the sibling of the deleted node is red, perform rotations and recoloring to make the sibling black, pushing the extra blackness up to the parent.

   b. **Sibling is Black with Red Nephew:** If the sibling of the deleted node is black and has at least one red child (nephew), perform rotations and recoloring to borrow a black node from the sibling.

   c. **Sibling is Black with Black Nephews:** If the sibling of the deleted node is black and has black children, we need to perform recoloring and rotations to fix the tree structure and maintain Red-Black properties. This case can further split into two cases:

      - **Parent is Red:** In this case, recoloring and rotations are performed to balance the tree while maintaining Red-Black properties.

      - **Parent is Black:** In this case, we push the extra blackness up to the parent, effectively increasing the black height of the subtree rooted at the parent. This might require further adjustments up the tree to ensure that Red-Black properties are maintained.

These cases ensure that after deletion, the Red-Black Tree properties are preserved, including the root being black, no two consecutive red nodes, every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes, and more.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Tree vs 2-3-4 Tree Deletion

Both Red-Black Trees (RBTs) and 2-3-4 Trees are self-balancing binary search trees, but they have different structures and mechanisms for maintaining balance. When it comes to deletion, there are some differences in their approaches:

1. **Red-Black Tree (RBT) Deletion**:
    - RBTs follow a specific set of rules to ensure balance, maintaining properties like black height balance and red-black coloring.
    - Deletion in RBTs can be complex due to the need to maintain these properties.
    - When a node is deleted, it may leave the tree in an unbalanced state or violate the red-black properties.
    - To restore balance, a series of rotations and color changes are performed, similar to the operations done during insertion.
    - After these rotations and color changes, the tree's properties are restored, and the tree remains balanced.

2. **2-3-4 Tree Deletion**:
    - 2-3-4 Trees are based on nodes that can have 2, 3, or 4 children, hence the name.
    - Deletion in a 2-3-4 Tree involves several cases, depending on the structure of the tree and the node being deleted.
    - Like RBTs, the goal is to maintain balance and adhere to the properties of the tree.
    - When a node is deleted, it may lead to underflow in its parent node.
    - To handle underflow, redistribution of keys among siblings or merging of nodes may be necessary.
    - This redistribution or merging ensures that all nodes maintain the balance property of the 2-3-4 Tree.

In summary, both RBTs and 2-3-4 Trees have their own mechanisms for deletion, but the fundamental goal is to maintain balance within the tree structure. RBTs achieve this through rotations and color changes, while 2-3-4 Trees use redistribution and merging of nodes to balance the tree. Each approach has its own set of advantages and considerations depending on the specific requirements of the application.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Trees

Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They are named after the properties they maintain: every node is either red or black, and the following properties hold:

1. **Red/Black Property**:
   - Every node is either red or black.
   - The root is always black.
   - Red nodes cannot have red children (no two adjacent red nodes).
   - Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes must have the same number of black nodes.

2. **Binary Search Tree Property**:
   - For each node, all nodes in its left subtree have keys less than its key, and all nodes in its right subtree have keys greater than its key.

Red-Black Trees maintain balance through rotations and color flips, ensuring that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This guarantees an \(O(\log n)\) time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

Here's a brief overview of the operations:

1. **Insertion**:
   - Insert the node as in a regular binary search tree.
   - Adjust tree structure and recolor nodes to maintain Red-Black properties.
   - Perform rotations if necessary to balance the tree.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Similar to insertion, delete the node as in a regular binary search tree.
   - If a black node is deleted, adjust the tree and recolor nodes as necessary to maintain Red-Black properties.
   - Perform rotations and color changes to rebalance the tree.

3. **Search**:
   - Traverse the tree from the root following the binary search tree property.
   - Time complexity is \(O(\log n)\) due to the balanced nature of the tree.

4. **Rotation Operations**:
   - Left Rotation: Rotate a node to the left to balance the tree.
   - Right Rotation: Rotate a node to the right to balance the tree.

Red-Black Trees are widely used in various libraries and frameworks due to their balance properties, such as in C++'s STL set and map implementations. They provide efficient performance for insertion, deletion, and search operations, making them suitable for a wide range of applications where ordered data storage and retrieval are needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Trees - Deletion

Red-Black Trees (RBT) are a type of self-balancing binary search tree that ensure the tree remains approximately balanced, leading to efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup. Red-Black Trees are widely used in various applications such as the implementation of associative arrays, for example, in the C++ Standard Library's `map` and `set`.

### Properties of Red-Black Trees

1. **Node Color**: Each node is either red or black.
2. **Root Property**: The root is always black.
3. **Leaf Property**: All leaves (NIL nodes) are black.
4. **Red Property**: Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes can be adjacent).
5. **Black Property**: Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes has the same number of black nodes.

### Deletion Algorithm

The deletion algorithm for a Red-Black Tree involves three main steps:

1. **BST Deletion**: Delete the node similarly to how you would in a regular binary search tree.
2. **Fixing the Tree**: After deletion, the tree may violate the red-black properties, so you need to fix the tree.
3. **Rotation and Recoloring**: Adjust the tree using rotations and recoloring to restore the red-black properties.

#### Step-by-Step Deletion Process

1. **BST Deletion**:
    - Find the node to delete, say `z`.
    - If `z` has at most one non-NIL child, remove `z`. Otherwise, find `z`'s successor `y` (which has no left child), swap them, and then remove `z`.

2. **Fixing the Tree**:
    - If the deleted node or its child (which replaced it) was red, no properties are violated.
    - If both were black, the tree might violate properties, especially the black property. We need to fix these violations using a series of cases.

3. **Rebalancing with Rotations and Recoloring**:
    - **Case 1**: The node `x` (replacement node or sibling node) is red. Rotate and recolor to fix the tree.
    - **Case 2**: Both `x` and `x`'s sibling are black, and `x`'s sibling's children are black. Recolor the sibling and move up the tree.
    - **Case 3**: `x` is black, `x`'s sibling is black, and the sibling's children are not all black. Perform rotations and recoloring to balance the tree.

### Example of C++ Code for Deletion

Here's a simplified version of the C++ code for deleting a node from a Red-Black Tree. This code assumes the basic structure of a Red-Black Tree and helper functions such as rotations and fix-up are already defined.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class RedBlackTree {
    struct Node {
        T data;
        Node* left;
        Node* right;
        Node* parent;
        bool isRed;

        Node(T data) : data(data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr), parent(nullptr), isRed(true) {}
    };

    Node* root;
    Node* NIL;

    void deleteFixup(Node* x) {
        while (x != root && !x->isRed) {
            if (x == x->parent->left) {
                Node* w = x->parent->right;
                if (w->isRed) {
                    w->isRed = false;
                    x->parent->isRed = true;
                    leftRotate(x->parent);
                    w = x->parent->right;
                }
                if (!w->left->isRed && !w->right->isRed) {
                    w->isRed = true;
                    x = x->parent;
                } else {
                    if (!w->right->isRed) {

### Summary

- **Step 1**: Perform a standard BST deletion.
- **Step 2**: Identify if there is any violation of Red-Black properties.
- **Step 3**: Fix violations using rotations and recoloring.

Understanding and implementing Red-Black Tree deletion requires familiarity with tree rotations, the properties of Red-Black Trees, and the specific cases that can occur during deletion. Practicing these concepts with code examples can help solidify your understanding.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Trees - Insertion

Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree, used to maintain a balanced structure to ensure efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. When inserting a new node into a red-black tree, several rules must be followed to maintain its properties:

1. **Every node is either red or black.**
2. **The root is always black.**
3. **Red nodes cannot have red children.**
4. **Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes (leaves) must have the same number of black nodes.**

Here's a C++ implementation of the insertion algorithm for red-black trees:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum Color { RED, BLACK };

struct Node {
    int data;
    Color color;
    Node* parent;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int data) : data(data), color(RED), parent(nullptr), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class RedBlackTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Rotate left at given node
    void rotateLeft(Node* node) {
        Node* rightChild = node->right;
        node->right = rightChild->left;
        if (rightChild->left != nullptr)
            rightChild->left->parent = node;
        rightChild->parent = node->parent;
        if (node->parent == nullptr)
            root = rightChild;
        else if (node == node->parent->left)
            node->parent->left = rightChild;
        else
            node->parent->right = rightChild;
        rightChild->left = node;
        node->parent = rightChild;
    }

    // Rotate right at given node
    void rotateRight(Node* node) {
        Node* leftChild = node->left;
        node->left = leftChild->right;
        if (leftChild->right != nullptr)
            leftChild->right->parent = node;
        leftChild->parent = node->parent;
        if (node->parent == nullptr)
            root = leftChild;
        else if (node == node->parent->right)
            node->parent->right = leftChild;
        else
            node->parent->left = leftChild;
        leftChild->right = node;
        node->parent = leftChild;
    }

    // Fix the red-black tree properties after insertion
    void fixInsert(Node* node) {
        while (node != root && node->parent->color == RED) {
            if (node->parent == node->parent->parent->left) {
                Node* uncle = node->parent->parent->right;
                if (uncle != nullptr && uncle->color == RED) {
                    node->parent->color = BLACK;
                    uncle->color = BLACK;
                    node->parent->parent->color = RED;
                    node = node->parent->parent;
                } else {
                    if (node == node->parent->right) {
                        node = node->parent;
                        rotateLeft(node);
                    }
                    node->parent->color = BLACK;
                    node->parent->parent->color = RED;
                    rotateRight(node->parent->parent);
                }
            } else {
                Node* uncle = node->parent->parent->left;
                if (uncle != nullptr && uncle->color == RED) {
                    node->parent->color = BLACK;
                    uncle->color = BLACK;
                    node->parent->parent->color = RED;
                    node = node->parent->parent;
                } else {
                    if (node == node->parent->left) {
                        node = node->parent;
                        rotateRight(node);
                    }
                    node->parent->color = BLACK;
                    node->parent->parent->color = RED;
                    rotateLeft(node->parent->parent);
                }
            }
        }
        root->color = BLACK;
    }

    // Helper function to insert a node recursively
    Node* insertHelper(Node* root, Node* newNode) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return newNode;

        if (newNode->data < root->data) {
            root->left = insertHelper(root->left, newNode);
            root->left->parent = root;
        } else if (newNode->data > root->data) {
            root->right = insertHelper(root->right, newNode);
            root->right->parent = root;
        }

        return root;
    }

public:
    RedBlackTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Insert a new node
    void insert(int data) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(data);
        root = insertHelper(root, newNode);
        fixInsert(newNode);
    }

    // Inorder traversal
    void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
        if (root != nullptr) {
            inorderTraversal(root->left);
            std::cout << root->data << " ";
            inorderTraversal(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Utility function to perform inorder traversal
    void inorder() {
        inorderTraversal(root);
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    RedBlackTree tree;
    tree.insert(7);
    tree.insert(3);
    tree.insert(18);
    tree.insert(10);
    tree.insert(22);
    tree.insert(8);
    tree.insert(11);
    tree.insert(26);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the Red-Black Tree: ";
    tree.inorder();

    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of a red-black tree in C++. The `insert` function inserts a new node into the tree and then calls `fixInsert` to maintain the red-black tree properties. The `inorderTraversal` function is used to perform an inorder traversal of the tree, and `inorder` is a utility function to call `inorderTraversal` starting from the root.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Trees - Restructuring

Red-black trees are balanced binary search trees with additional properties that ensure logarithmic height, hence efficient operations like insertion, deletion, and search. One critical operation in maintaining the balance of a red-black tree is restructuring, also known as rotations.

Restructuring involves rotating nodes in the tree to maintain the red-black properties. There are four types of rotations:

1. **Left Rotation (LL Rotation)**: This rotation is used to fix the imbalance when a node has a red child on its right. It rotates the node to the left.

2. **Right Rotation (RR Rotation)**: This rotation is used to fix the imbalance when a node has a red child on its left. It rotates the node to the right.

3. **Left-Right Rotation (LR Rotation)**: This rotation involves two steps - a left rotation followed by a right rotation. It's used when the left child of a node has a red child on its right.

4. **Right-Left Rotation (RL Rotation)**: This rotation also involves two steps - a right rotation followed by a left rotation. It's used when the right child of a node has a red child on its left.

Here's a brief overview of how these rotations are implemented in C++:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int key;
    bool isRed; // Indicates whether the node is red or black
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* parent;
};

// Function to perform left rotation
void leftRotate(Node* &root, Node* x) {
    Node* y = x->right;
    x->right = y->left;
    if (y->left != nullptr)
        y->left->parent = x;
    y->parent = x->parent;
    if (x->parent == nullptr)
        root = y;
    else if (x == x->parent->left)
        x->parent->left = y;
    else
        x->parent->right = y;
    y->left = x;
    x->parent = y;
}

// Function to perform right rotation
void rightRotate(Node* &root, Node* y) {
    Node* x = y->left;
    y->left = x->right;
    if (x->right != nullptr)
        x->right->parent = y;
    x->parent = y->parent;
    if (y->parent == nullptr)
        root = x;
    else if (y == y->parent->right)
        y->parent->right = x;
    else
        y->parent->left = x;
    x->right = y;
    y->parent = x;
}

// Function to fix the tree after insertion or deletion by applying rotations
void fixViolation(Node* &root, Node* &pt) {
    Node* parent_pt = nullptr;
    Node* grand_parent_pt = nullptr;

    while ((pt != root) && (pt->isRed) && (pt->parent->isRed)) {
        parent_pt = pt->parent;
        grand_parent_pt = pt->parent->parent;

        /* Case : A */
        if (parent_pt == grand_parent_pt->left) {
            Node* uncle_pt = grand_parent_pt->right;
            if (uncle_pt != nullptr && uncle_pt->isRed) {
                grand_parent_pt->isRed = true;
                parent_pt->isRed = false;
                uncle_pt->isRed = false;
                pt = grand_parent_pt;
            } else {
                /* Case : B */
                if (pt == parent_pt->right) {
                    leftRotate(root, parent_pt);
                    pt = parent_pt;
                    parent_pt = pt->parent;
                }
                /* Case : C */
                rightRotate(root, grand_parent_pt);
                std::swap(parent_pt->isRed, grand_parent_pt->isRed);
                pt = parent_pt;
            }
        } else {
            Node* uncle_pt = grand_parent_pt->left;
            if (uncle_pt != nullptr && uncle_pt->isRed) {
                grand_parent_pt->isRed = true;
                parent_pt->isRed = false;
                uncle_pt->isRed = false;
                pt = grand_parent_pt;
            } else {
                /* Case : B */
                if (pt == parent_pt->left) {
                    rightRotate(root, parent_pt);
                    pt = parent_pt;
                    parent_pt = pt->parent;
                }
                /* Case : C */
                leftRotate(root, grand_parent_pt);
                std::swap(parent_pt->isRed, grand_parent_pt->isRed);
                pt = parent_pt;
            }
        }
    }

    root->isRed = false;
}
```

These functions are used to maintain the red-black tree properties after insertion or deletion operations. Restructuring ensures that the tree remains balanced and maintains the red-black properties, which are crucial for the performance of the red-black tree operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Red-Black Trees vs 2-3-4 Trees

Red-Black Trees and 2-3-4 Trees are both self-balancing binary search trees used to maintain a sorted collection of elements. Here's a comparison between the two:

1. **Basic Structure:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** Each node is colored either red or black. Nodes store keys, and pointers to left and right children.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** Nodes in a 2-3-4 tree can have 2, 3, or 4 children. These trees are always balanced, with each node containing either one, two, or three keys.

2. **Insertion and Deletion:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** When a new element is inserted, the tree is adjusted to maintain five properties: root is black, no two red nodes are adjacent, every path from root to leaf has the same number of black nodes, new nodes are always inserted as red, and no red node has a red child.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** Insertions and deletions can cause restructuring of the tree to maintain balance. If a node overflows (has more than three keys), it's split, and the middle key is moved up. If a node underflows (has fewer than two keys), it's merged with a neighboring node.

3. **Balancing:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** Balancing is done using rotations and recoloring. The tree is balanced such that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice the length of the shortest path.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** Balancing is achieved by restructuring nodes when insertions or deletions cause violations of the tree properties. This restructuring involves splitting or merging nodes to maintain balance.

4. **Performance:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** While the worst-case time complexity for operations like search, insertion, and deletion is O(log n), where n is the number of elements, Red-Black Trees often have a slightly simpler structure and may perform slightly better in practice due to fewer rotations.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** The worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion is also O(log n). However, 2-3-4 Trees may require more restructuring operations during insertions and deletions compared to Red-Black Trees, which can affect performance.

5. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** Typically uses less memory overhead compared to 2-3-4 Trees because it only requires one extra bit per node for color information.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** Requires more memory overhead due to the need to store multiple keys per node and potentially multiple child pointers.

6. **Ease of Implementation:**
   - **Red-Black Tree:** Generally considered easier to implement due to its simpler structure and balancing rules.
   - **2-3-4 Tree:** Requires more complex implementation due to the varying number of keys per node and the need to handle node restructuring.

In summary, both Red-Black Trees and 2-3-4 Trees are efficient self-balancing binary search trees with their own advantages and disadvantages. Red-Black Trees are often favored for their simpler implementation and slightly better performance in practice, while 2-3-4 Trees offer theoretical advantages in terms of balancing and memory efficiency. The choice between them depends on specific requirements, such as the importance of theoretical performance guarantees versus ease of implementation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Removal in Binary Search Trees

In C++, removal in binary search trees (BSTs) involves several cases depending on the node to be removed. Here's a general approach:

1. **Find the Node**: Search for the node to be removed. If it's not found, the tree remains unchanged.
2. **Identify Cases**: Once found, there are three cases:
    - If the node has no children (it's a leaf), simply remove it.
    - If the node has one child, replace the node with its child.
    - If the node has two children, find its in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree), replace the node's value with the successor's value, and then remove the successor node.
3. **Recursive Removal**: Recursively perform the removal operation on the appropriate subtree.
4. **Update Heights/Balances**: If you're dealing with an AVL tree or another self-balancing BST, you might need to update heights or balances of the nodes in the path back to the root.

Here's a sample implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr)
        node = node->left;
    return node;
}

TreeNode* removeNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = removeNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 30;
    root = removeNode(root, key);

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation demonstrates removal in a binary search tree and then traverses the tree in-order to confirm the deletion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Removal in Binary Search Trees: Theory

Sure, let's delve into the theory behind removing nodes in Binary Search Trees (BSTs) using C++.

Binary Search Trees are data structures that store items in a sorted manner, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Each node in a BST has at most two children: a left child and a right child. The key property of a BST is that for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

When removing a node from a BST, there are a few cases to consider:

1. **Node with no children (leaf node)**: If the node to be removed has no children, we can simply remove it from the tree.

2. **Node with one child**: If the node to be removed has only one child, we can replace the node with its child.

3. **Node with two children**: This is the most complex case. If the node to be removed has two children, we need to find its in-order successor (or predecessor) and replace the node's value with the value of the successor (or predecessor). Then, we need to remove the successor (or predecessor), which falls into either of the first two cases.

To implement removal in a BST in C++, we typically use recursion. Here's a general outline of how the removal algorithm might look:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* root) {
    while (root->left != nullptr) {
        root = root->left;
    }
    return root;
}

TreeNode* removeNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = removeNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children, find the in-order successor (min node in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}
```

This implementation recursively searches for the node to be removed and handles the three cases discussed above.

Remember, in C++, it's crucial to deallocate memory properly when removing nodes to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Remove in Binary Search Tree

Certainly! Removing a node from a binary search tree (BST) in C++ involves a few steps:

1. Find the node to remove.
2. Handle cases where the node has zero, one, or two children.
3. Adjust the pointers to maintain the BST properties.

Here's an implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* findMin(TreeNode* node) {
    while (node->left != nullptr)
        node = node->left;
    return node;
}

TreeNode* removeNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = removeNode(root->left, key);
    } else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, key);
    } else {
        // Node to delete found
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node has two children
        TreeNode* temp = findMin(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = removeNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    std::cout << "Original BST: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    root = removeNode(root, 3); // Remove node with value 3

    std::cout << "BST after removal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct representing a node in the BST, and then provides functions to find the minimum node in the right subtree (`findMin`) and to remove a node from the BST (`removeNode`). Finally, it demonstrates the usage of these functions in the `main` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Remove node from binary search tree

Certainly! In C++, you can remove a node from a binary search tree (BST) by following these steps:

1. Find the node to be deleted.
2. If the node has no children, simply remove it.
3. If the node has one child, replace the node with its child.
4. If the node has two children, find the node's successor (or predecessor), which is the smallest (or largest) node in its right (or left) subtree. Replace the node's value with the successor's value and delete the successor node.
5. Recursively repeat the above steps until the node is deleted.

Here's a sample implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the binary search tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the minimum value node in a BST
TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr) {
        current = current->left;
    }
    return current;
}

// Function to delete a node from BST
TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr) return root;

    // If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's key, then it lies in the left subtree
    if (key < root->val) {
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    }
    // If the key to be deleted is greater than the root's key, then it lies in the right subtree
    else if (key > root->val) {
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    }
    // If key is the same as root's key, then this is the node to be deleted
    else {
        // Node with only one child or no child
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        } else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }

        // Node with two children: Get the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree)
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);

        // Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root->val = temp->val;

        // Delete the inorder successor
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(50);
    root->left = new TreeNode(30);
    root->right = new TreeNode(70);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(40);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(60);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(80);

    cout << "Inorder traversal before deletion: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    int key = 30;
    root = deleteNode(root, key);

    cout << "Inorder traversal after deletion of " << key << ": ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program demonstrates how to create a binary search tree, perform an inorder traversal before and after deleting a node (in this case, the node with the value 30), and print the results.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Remove node from binary search tree: Complexity analysis

When analyzing the complexity of removing a node from a binary search tree (BST) in C++, we need to consider two main scenarios: removing a leaf node and removing a node with one or two children.

1. **Removing a Leaf Node:**
   If the node to be removed is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), the operation is relatively straightforward. We simply locate the node and remove it. The complexity of this operation is determined by the height of the tree. Since in the worst-case scenario, we may need to traverse the height of the tree to find the node, the time complexity is O(h), where 'h' is the height of the tree. In a balanced BST, the height is typically O(log n), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Removing a Node with One Child:**
   If the node to be removed has only one child, we replace the node with its child. Again, the time complexity is determined by the height of the tree. Like removing a leaf node, the worst-case time complexity is O(h).

3. **Removing a Node with Two Children:**
   Removing a node with two children is a bit more complex. We need to find the node's in-order successor (or predecessor), which is the smallest (or largest) node in the node's right (or left) subtree. Then, we replace the node to be removed with its in-order successor (or predecessor), and finally, we remove the in-order successor (or predecessor) from its original position. The complexity of this operation is also determined by the height of the tree, so it's O(h).

Overall, the time complexity of removing a node from a binary search tree in the worst case is O(h), where 'h' is the height of the tree. In the best-case scenario, when the tree is balanced, the height is O(log n), making the removal operation very efficient. However, in the worst case, when the tree is skewed, the height can be as bad as O(n), making the removal operation less efficient.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Runtime characteristic of Binary Search Tree

The runtime characteristics of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ depend on the operation being performed. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Insertion**: When inserting a new element into a BST, the average-case time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. This assumes the tree is balanced. However, in the worst case, when the tree is unbalanced, insertion can take O(n) time, where n is the number of elements, as the tree might degrade into a linked list.

2. **Deletion**: Deleting an element from a BST also has a time complexity of O(log n) on average if the tree is balanced. However, in the worst-case scenario, deletion can also take O(n) time if the tree is highly unbalanced.

3. **Search**: Searching for an element in a balanced BST takes O(log n) time on average. However, if the tree is unbalanced, searching can take up to O(n) time, similar to insertion and deletion.

It's worth noting that maintaining the balance of the BST is crucial to ensure optimal performance. Self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees are designed to automatically maintain balance, guaranteeing O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations in the worst case.

In summary, the runtime characteristics of a Binary Search Tree in C++ are generally O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and search operations in the average case, but can degrade to O(n) in the worst case if the tree becomes unbalanced.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Search in a Binary Search Tree

Sure, here's an implementation of searching for a value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    // Function to search for a value in BST
    TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        // Base Cases: root is null or val is present at root
        if (root == NULL || root->val == val)
            return root;
        
        // Value is greater than root's value, so search right subtree
        if (root->val < val)
            return search(root->right, val);
        
        // Value is smaller than root's value, so search left subtree
        return search(root->left, val);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    BST bst;

    // Creating a sample binary search tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(12);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Searching for a value
    int value = 7;
    TreeNode* result = bst.search(root, value);

    if (result != NULL)
        cout << "Value " << value << " is present in the tree." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Value " << value << " is not present in the tree." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the structure of a TreeNode representing each node in the binary search tree.
- The `BST` class contains the `search` function, which recursively searches for a given value in the BST.
- In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `BST` class and a sample binary search tree. We then search for a value (`value = 7` in this example) using the `search` function and print whether it's present in the tree or not.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Search in Binary Search Trees

Certainly! Searching in a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental operation. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to search a key in BST
TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    // Base Cases: root is null or val is present at root
    if (root == nullptr || root->val == val)
        return root;

    // val is greater than root's key
    if (root->val < val)
        return searchBST(root->right, val);

    // val is smaller than root's key
    return searchBST(root->left, val);
}

// Utility function to create a new BST node
TreeNode* newNode(int item) {
    TreeNode* temp = new TreeNode(item);
    return temp;
}

// Utility function to do inorder traversal of BST
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorder(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
}

// Driver program to test above functions
int main() {
    /* Let's create the following BST
                50
             /     \
            30      70
           /  \    /  \
         20   40  60   80 */

    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = newNode(50);
    root->left = newNode(30);
    root->right = newNode(70);
    root->left->left = newNode(20);
    root->left->right = newNode(40);
    root->right->left = newNode(60);
    root->right->right = newNode(80);

    int key = 40;
    TreeNode* result = searchBST(root, key);
    if (result != nullptr)
        std::cout << "Element found: " << result->val << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Element not found" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree.
- `searchBST` is the main function that searches for a given value in the BST.
- `newNode` is a utility function to create a new node.
- `inorder` is a utility function to perform an inorder traversal of the BST.
- In the `main` function, a BST is created, and then `searchBST` is called to search for a key value (in this case, `40`).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Search Operation in Binary Search Tree

Certainly! In C++, implementing a search operation in a binary search tree (BST) involves recursively traversing the tree starting from the root and comparing the target value with the values of nodes encountered during traversal. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function for search operation
    TreeNode* searchHelper(TreeNode* node, int target) {
        // If node is null or matches target, return node
        if (node == nullptr || node->val == target) {
            return node;
        }
        // If target is less than current node's value, search left subtree
        if (target < node->val) {
            return searchHelper(node->left, target);
        }
        // If target is greater than current node's value, search right subtree
        return searchHelper(node->right, target);
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Insertion method (not necessary for search but included for completeness)
    void insert(int val) {
        root = insertHelper(root, val);
    }

    TreeNode* insertHelper(TreeNode* node, int val) {
        // If tree is empty, create a new node
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }
        // Otherwise, recur down the tree
        if (val < node->val) {
            node->left = insertHelper(node->left, val);
        } else if (val > node->val) {
            node->right = insertHelper(node->right, val);
        }
        return node;
    }

    // Search method
    bool search(int target) {
        TreeNode* result = searchHelper(root, target);
        return result != nullptr;
    }
};

int main() {
    BST tree;
    // Insert some elements into the tree
    tree.insert(5);
    tree.insert(3);
    tree.insert(7);
    tree.insert(2);
    tree.insert(4);
    tree.insert(6);
    tree.insert(8);

    // Perform searches
    std::cout << "Searching for 4: " << (tree.search(4) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Searching for 9: " << (tree.search(9) ? "Found" : "Not Found") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree, containing a value (`val`) and pointers to its left and right children.
- `BST` is a class representing the binary search tree with methods for insertion and search.
- The `searchHelper` function is a recursive helper function to perform the search operation.
- In the `main` function, we create a binary search tree, insert some elements into it, and then perform search operations on it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Searching in a Binary Search Tree

In C++, searching in a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental operation. Here's an example of how you can implement a search function for a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    TreeNode* root;

    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a new node in the BST
    TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }
        if (val < root->val) {
            root->left = insert(root->left, val);
        } else if (val > root->val) {
            root->right = insert(root->right, val);
        }
        return root;
    }

    // Function to search for a value in the BST
    bool search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        if (root->val == val) {
            return true;
        } else if (val < root->val) {
            return search(root->left, val);
        } else {
            return search(root->right, val);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    BST bst;
    // Inserting elements into the BST
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 10);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 5);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 15);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 3);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 8);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 12);
    bst.root = bst.insert(bst.root, 18);

    // Searching for elements in the BST
    std::cout << "Is 5 present in the BST? " << (bst.search(bst.root, 5) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Is 7 present in the BST? " << (bst.search(bst.root, 7) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `TreeNode` struct to represent nodes in the binary tree. The `BST` class contains member functions for insertion (`insert`) and searching (`search`). The `insert` function inserts a new node into the BST while maintaining the BST property, and the `search` function searches for a given value in the BST recursively. Finally, in the `main` function, we demonstrate the usage of these functions by inserting some elements into the BST and searching for specific values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Searching In Binary Search Tree

In C++, implementing searching in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves traversing the tree efficiently to find a specific value. Here's an example implementation of searching in a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
private:
    Node* root;

    Node* insertRecursive(Node* current, int value) {
        if (current == nullptr) {
            return new Node(value);
        }

        if (value < current->data) {
            current->left = insertRecursive(current->left, value);
        } else if (value > current->data) {
            current->right = insertRecursive(current->right, value);
        }

        return current;
    }

    bool searchRecursive(Node* current, int value) {
        if (current == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (value == current->data) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < current->data) {
            return searchRecursive(current->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchRecursive(current->right, value);
        }
    }

public:
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}

    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    bool search(int value) {
        return searchRecursive(root, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    BST tree;
    tree.insert(10);
    tree.insert(5);
    tree.insert(15);
    tree.insert(3);
    tree.insert(7);
    
    int searchValue = 7;
    if (tree.search(searchValue)) {
        std::cout << "Found " << searchValue << " in the tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << searchValue << " not found in the tree." << std::endl;
    }

    searchValue = 12;
    if (tree.search(searchValue)) {
        std::cout << "Found " << searchValue << " in the tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << searchValue << " not found in the tree." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We define a `Node` struct to represent each node in the BST.
- The `BST` class has private helper functions for insertion and searching, which are called recursively.
- `insert` function inserts a value into the BST.
- `search` function searches for a value in the BST.
- In the `main` function, we create a BST, insert some values, and then search for values within the tree.

This is a basic example. In practice, you might want to consider more advanced scenarios, such as handling duplicate values, deleting nodes, or balancing the tree for better performance.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Simple Binary Search Trees

Sure, I can guide you through implementing a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    // Constructor
    TreeNode(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Binary Search Tree class
class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function to recursively insert a value into the tree
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < root->data) {
            root->left = insertRecursive(root->left, value);
        } else if (value > root->data) {
            root->right = insertRecursive(root->right, value);
        }

        return root;
    }

    // Helper function to recursively search for a value in the tree
    bool searchRecursive(TreeNode* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (value == root->data) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < root->data) {
            return searchRecursive(root->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchRecursive(root->right, value);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BinarySearchTree() {
        root = nullptr;
    }

    // Public method to insert a value into the tree
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Public method to search for a value in the tree
    bool search(int value) {
        return searchRecursive(root, value);
    }
};

int main() {
    BinarySearchTree bst;

    // Insert some values into the tree
    bst.insert(10);
    bst.insert(5);
    bst.insert(15);
    bst.insert(3);
    bst.insert(7);
    bst.insert(12);
    bst.insert(17);

    // Search for values in the tree
    cout << "Searching for 5: " << (bst.search(5) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;
    cout << "Searching for 8: " << (bst.search(8) ? "Found" : "Not found") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

1. We define a `TreeNode` struct that represents a node in the binary search tree. It contains data, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.

2. We define the `BinarySearchTree` class, which includes private helper functions for recursive insertion and searching.

3. The `insert` function inserts a new value into the tree by calling the recursive `insertRecursive` function.

4. The `search` function searches for a value in the tree by calling the recursive `searchRecursive` function.

5. In the `main` function, we create a `BinarySearchTree` object, insert some values into the tree, and then search for specific values to demonstrate the functionality of the binary search tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Sorted Nodes at Distance K

To implement an algorithm that finds nodes at distance K from a given node in a binary search tree (BST) using C++, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the structure for a tree node with data and pointers to left and right children.
2. Implement a function to insert nodes into the BST.
3. Implement a function to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the given target node, keeping track of the distance from the target node.
4. Utilize the DFS function to find nodes at distance K from the target node.

Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Define a structure for tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a node into BST
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) return new TreeNode(val);
    if (val < root->val)
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    else if (val > root->val)
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    return root;
}

// Perform DFS from the target node to find nodes at distance K
void dfs(TreeNode* node, int k, vector<int>& result, int distance) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;
    if (distance == k) {
        result.push_back(node->val);
        return;
    }
    dfs(node->left, k, result, distance + 1);
    dfs(node->right, k, result, distance + 1);
}

// Find nodes at distance K from the target node
vector<int> findNodesAtDistanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (root == nullptr || target == nullptr) return result;
    dfs(target, k, result, 0); // Start DFS from the target node
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    root = insert(root, 20);
    root = insert(root, 10);
    root = insert(root, 30);
    root = insert(root, 5);
    root = insert(root, 15);
    root = insert(root, 25);
    root = insert(root, 35);

    // Let's find nodes at distance 2 from node with value 10
    TreeNode* targetNode = root->left; // Node with value 10
    int k = 2;
    vector<int> nodesAtDistanceK = findNodesAtDistanceK(root, targetNode, k);

    // Print the nodes at distance K
    cout << "Nodes at distance " << k << " from node " << targetNode->val << ":" << endl;
    for (int nodeVal : nodesAtDistanceK) {
        cout << nodeVal << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code first creates a binary search tree, then finds nodes at distance K from a specified target node. You can modify it according to your specific requirements or integrate it into a larger project as needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Special Binary Search Trees

Special Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are variations of traditional binary search trees that are optimized for specific operations or properties. Two common types of special BSTs are AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

1. **AVL Trees**:
   - AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
   - Insertions and deletions in AVL trees may require rotations to maintain balance, ensuring that the tree remains relatively balanced, which helps in keeping search, insertion, and deletion operations efficient (O(log n) time complexity for these operations).

2. **Red-Black Trees**:
   - Red-Black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree. They ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced by enforcing several properties on the nodes.
   - Each node of a red-black tree is colored either red or black, and the tree must satisfy five properties:
     1. Every node is either red or black.
     2. The root is black.
     3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
     4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
     5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
   - Red-Black trees guarantee logarithmic time for the basic operations of insertion, deletion, and search.

These special BSTs are widely used in computer science and software engineering due to their efficient performance characteristics and the guarantee of balanced trees, which helps maintain optimal search and update operations over time.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Splay Trees

Splay trees are a type of self-adjusting binary search tree with excellent amortized performance for many operations. They were invented by Daniel Sleator and Robert Tarjan in 1985. The main idea behind splay trees is to bring frequently accessed nodes closer to the root by performing tree rotations during search, insertion, and deletion operations. This way, recently accessed elements are quicker to access in subsequent operations.

Here's a high-level overview of the key operations in a splay tree:

1. **Search**: When searching for a node in a splay tree, the tree is traversed as in a standard binary search tree. However, after the node is found (or determined to be absent), the tree is restructured by performing a series of rotations to bring the accessed node closer to the root. This helps to improve the performance of future searches involving nearby nodes.

2. **Insertion**: To insert a new node into a splay tree, the tree is first searched for the appropriate location to insert the new node. Once the insertion point is found, the new node is added as a leaf node. Then, the tree is restructured by performing a series of rotations to bring the newly inserted node closer to the root.

3. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from a splay tree involves first finding the node to be deleted. Once the node is found, it is removed from the tree. Then, the tree is restructured by performing a series of rotations to maintain the properties of a binary search tree.

The key property of splay trees is that after a sequence of operations, the tree becomes more balanced, which leads to efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. However, it's important to note that individual operations in a splay tree can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n), but the amortized time complexity over a sequence of operations is often much better.

Implementing a splay tree in C++ involves defining a node structure representing each element in the tree and implementing the various operations such as search, insertion, deletion, and rotations. You can find many resources online with detailed explanations and sample code for implementing splay trees in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Splay Trees - Splaying

Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees that aim to provide fast access to recently accessed elements by moving them closer to the root. One of the key operations in splay trees is splaying, which involves restructuring the tree to bring the most recently accessed node to the root.

Here's an overview of the splaying process:

1. **Access Operation**: Whenever a node is accessed (searched, inserted, or deleted), the tree undergoes a series of rotations and restructuring operations to bring the accessed node to the root. This process is known as splaying.

2. **Splaying Rules**: Splaying is typically done through a series of rotations called zig-zig, zig-zag, or single rotations. These rotations change the structure of the tree while maintaining the binary search tree property.

3. **Zig-Zig Rotation**: If both the accessed node and its parent are left children or both are right children, a zig-zig rotation is performed. This involves two consecutive rotations to bring the accessed node to the root.

4. **Zig-Zag Rotation**: If the accessed node and its parent are on opposite sides (one is a left child and the other is a right child), a zig-zag rotation is performed. This also involves two rotations.

5. **Single Rotation**: If the accessed node's parent is the root, a single rotation is performed to bring the accessed node to the root.

6. **Repeat if Necessary**: After each rotation, the process is repeated recursively until the accessed node becomes the root.

7. **Amortized Analysis**: Although each splay operation might take O(n) time in the worst case, the amortized time complexity is typically considered to be O(log n), making splay trees efficient for many practical purposes.

Here's a simplified example of the splaying process in C++:

```cpp
void splay(Node* x) {
    while (x->parent != nullptr) {
        Node* parent = x->parent;
        Node* grandparent = parent->parent;
        if (grandparent == nullptr) {
            // Zig operation
            if (x == parent->left) {
                rotateRight(parent);
            } else {
                rotateLeft(parent);
            }
        } else {
            if ((x == parent->left && parent == grandparent->left) ||
                (x == parent->right && parent == grandparent->right)) {
                // Zig-zig operation
                if (x == parent->left) {
                    rotateRight(grandparent);
                    rotateRight(parent);
                } else {
                    rotateLeft(grandparent);
                    rotateLeft(parent);
                }
            } else {
                // Zig-zag operation
                if (x == parent->left) {
                    rotateRight(parent);
                    rotateLeft(grandparent);
                } else {
                    rotateLeft(parent);
                    rotateRight(grandparent);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Example rotation functions
void rotateRight(Node* x) {
    Node* y = x->left;
    if (y != nullptr) {
        x->left = y->right;
        if (y->right != nullptr) {
            y->right->parent = x;
        }
        y->parent = x->parent;
    }
    if (x->parent != nullptr) {
        if (x == x->parent->right) {
            x->parent->right = y;
        } else {
            x->parent->left = y;
        }
    }
    if (y != nullptr) {
        y->right = x;
    }
    x->parent = y;
}

void rotateLeft(Node* x) {
    Node* y = x->right;
    if (y != nullptr) {
        x->right = y->left;
        if (y->left != nullptr) {
            y->left->parent = x;
        }
        y->parent = x->parent;
    }
    if (x->parent != nullptr) {
        if (x == x->parent->left) {
            x->parent->left = y;
        } else {
            x->parent->right = y;
        }
    }
    if (y != nullptr) {
        y->left = x;
    }
    x->parent = y;
}
```

In this example, `rotateRight` and `rotateLeft` are helper functions to perform single rotations. The `splay` function performs the splaying operation on the node `x`. The actual implementation of splay trees might involve additional details such as maintaining tree properties and balancing.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Splay Trees - Zig Restructuring

In the context of Splay Trees, Zig Restructuring is a fundamental operation used to maintain the balance and efficiency of the tree. Splay Trees are a type of self-adjusting binary search tree, where every operation on the tree, such as insertion, deletion, and searching, is followed by a splay operation that reorganizes the tree to bring the most recently accessed node to the root.

Zig Restructuring is applied when the last accessed node (let's call it \( x \)) is either the left child of its parent (let's call it \( p \)), or when \( x \) is the right child of its parent and \( p \) is the root. In such cases, a single rotation (Zig rotation) is performed to bring \( x \) to the root position.

Here's the step-by-step process for Zig Restructuring:

1. **Zig Rotation**:
   - If \( x \) is the left child of \( p \):

     ```bash
                p               x
               / \             / \
              x   C    ==>    A   p
             / \                 / \
            A   B               B   C
     ```

   - If \( x \) is the right child of \( p \) and \( p \) is the root:

     ```bash
                p                x
                 \              / \
                  x     ==>   p   C
                 / \          / \
                A   C        A   B
     ```

After performing Zig Restructuring, \( x \) becomes the new root of the subtree, and the tree is restructured accordingly. This operation helps to maintain the balance of the Splay Tree and improves the access time for frequently accessed nodes by bringing them closer to the root.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Splay Trees - Zig-Zag Restructuring

In Splay Trees, Zig-Zag restructuring is a crucial operation that helps maintain the balance and efficiency of the tree. It's a part of the broader Splay Tree rotation operations designed to ensure that frequently accessed nodes move closer to the root, thus improving overall performance.

Here's how Zig-Zag restructuring works:

1. **Identify the Zig-Zag Pattern**: The Zig-Zag pattern occurs when a node (let's call it `x`) has a grandparent (`g`), and `x` is the right child of its parent (`p`), but `p` is the left child of `g`.

```bash
       g                       g                    x
      / \                     / \                  / \
     /   \                   /   \                /   \
    p     d   Zig-Zag     x     d    Rotate    p     g
   / \        ------>     / \          ---->   / \   / \
  /   \                 /   \                /   \ /   \
 a     x               p     c              a     b     d
      / \             / \
     /   \           /   \
    b     c         a     b
```

1. **Perform Zig-Zag Restructuring**:
   - Rotate `x` right about `p`.
   - Rotate `x` left about `g`.

1. **Update Pointers**: After the rotation, update the parent pointers accordingly to maintain the tree structure.

Zig-Zag restructuring helps in bringing `x` closer to the root (`g` in this case) by performing rotations. It can be a part of the Splay operation or used when inserting, deleting, or accessing nodes in the tree to maintain balance and ensure efficient access.

In C++, you would implement Zig-Zag restructuring as part of the Splay Tree operations. Here's a simplified example of how you might implement it:

```cpp
void zigZag(Node* x) {
    Node* p = x->parent;
    Node* g = p->parent;

    if (g->left == p && p->right == x) {
        // Zig-Zag case
        rotateLeft(x, p);
        rotateRight(x, g);
    } else if (g->right == p && p->left == x) {
        // Mirror Zig-Zag case
        rotateRight(x, p);
        rotateLeft(x, g);
    }

    // Update parent pointers if needed
}

void rotateLeft(Node* x, Node* p) {
    // Perform left rotation
}

void rotateRight(Node* x, Node* p) {
    // Perform right rotation
}
```

This code assumes you have a `Node` struct representing each node in the Splay Tree and functions `rotateLeft` and `rotateRight` to perform the rotation operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Splay Trees - Zig-Zig Restructuring

In the context of splay trees, Zig-Zig restructuring is one of the key operations used for tree rebalancing during insertion, deletion, or search operations. Splay trees are a type of self-adjusting binary search tree where frequently accessed elements move closer to the root, which optimizes search times.

The Zig-Zig operation is performed when a node, let's call it `X`, and its parent `P`, and the grandparent `G`, all form a zig-zig pattern. This means that `X` is a right child of `P`, and `P` is a right child of `G`, or vice versa. The zig-zig operation involves two rotations to restructure the tree and bring `X` closer to the root.

Here's a high-level overview of how Zig-Zig restructuring works:

1. **Identify the Zig-Zig Pattern**: Determine if the current node (`X`), its parent (`P`), and grandparent (`G`) form a zig-zig pattern.

2. **Perform Rotations**:
   - If `X`, `P`, and `G` form a right-right pattern:
     - Perform a left rotation at `G`.
     - Perform a left rotation at `P`.
   - If `X`, `P`, and `G` form a left-left pattern:
     - Perform a right rotation at `G`.
     - Perform a right rotation at `P`.

3. **Update Pointers**: After the rotations, update the pointers to maintain the tree structure.

By performing these rotations, the tree is restructured such that `X` moves closer to the root, reducing its depth and improving the overall balance of the tree.

Here's a pseudo-code representation of Zig-Zig restructuring:

```plaintext
ZigZigRestructure(X):
    if X is a right child and its parent P is also a right child:
        // Right-Right Zig-Zig pattern
        RotateLeft(G)   // Rotate left at Grandparent
        RotateLeft(P)   // Rotate left at Parent
    else if X is a left child and its parent P is also a left child:
        // Left-Left Zig-Zig pattern
        RotateRight(G)  // Rotate right at Grandparent
        RotateRight(P)  // Rotate right at Parent
```

The `RotateLeft` and `RotateRight` functions perform single left and right rotations, respectively, which are basic operations used in tree restructuring.

Zig-Zig restructuring is an essential part of the splay tree's self-adjusting behavior, ensuring that frequently accessed nodes move towards the root, improving the overall efficiency of operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Time and Space complexity of Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are a fundamental data structure in computer science, designed to facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Understanding their time and space complexity is crucial for analyzing their performance and making informed decisions about their usage. Let's delve into the time and space complexities of BST operations:

#### Time Complexity

1. **Search (Lookup):**
   - Average Case: O(log n) - On average, the search operation in a balanced BST takes logarithmic time since each comparison reduces the search space by half.
   - Worst Case: O(n) - If the BST is unbalanced (essentially degenerating into a linked list), the search operation may take linear time.

2. **Insertion:**
   - Average Case: O(log n) - Similar to search, inserting a node into a balanced BST takes logarithmic time.
   - Worst Case: O(n) - If the BST is highly unbalanced, insertion may require traversing through the entire height of the tree, leading to linear time complexity.

3. **Deletion:**
   - Average Case: O(log n) - Deleting a node from a balanced BST also takes logarithmic time on average.
   - Worst Case: O(n) - In the case where the tree becomes highly unbalanced after deletion, the time complexity can degrade to linear.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of a BST primarily depends on the number of nodes in the tree.

- Best Case: O(n) - In the best-case scenario, a balanced BST has a height of log(n) where n is the number of nodes, leading to O(n) space complexity.
- Worst Case: O(n) - In the worst-case scenario, where the BST degenerates into a linked list, the height of the tree becomes n, resulting in O(n) space complexity.

#### Balancing Operations

To ensure optimal time complexity, various self-balancing techniques such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, or Splay trees are employed. These techniques aim to maintain the height of the tree within a certain range, thereby preserving logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Understanding the nuances of balancing operations and their impact on time and space complexity is essential for designing efficient BST-based algorithms and applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Traverse Binary Search Trees

Traversing a binary search tree (BST) involves visiting each node in a specific order. There are three common traversal techniques: inorder, preorder, and postorder. Below, I'll provide C++ code examples for each traversal method:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right)
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    cout << root->val << " ";
    preorderTraversal(root->left);
    preorderTraversal(root->right);
}

// Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root)
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    postorderTraversal(root->left);
    postorderTraversal(root->right);
    cout << root->val << " ";
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `inorderTraversal` prints the nodes in sorted order.
- `preorderTraversal` is useful for creating a copy of the tree.
- `postorderTraversal` is useful for deleting the tree.

You can replace the `cout` statements with any other operations you want to perform with the nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Traversing Binary Search Tree

Traversing a binary search tree (BST) involves visiting all the nodes in a specific order. There are three common ways to traverse a BST:

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
2. **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
3. **Postorder Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

Here's how you can implement these traversals in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Inorder Traversal
    void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) {
            inorder(root->left);
            cout << root->val << " ";
            inorder(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Preorder Traversal
    void preorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) {
            cout << root->val << " ";
            preorder(root->left);
            preorder(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Postorder Traversal
    void postorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) {
            postorder(root->left);
            postorder(root->right);
            cout << root->val << " ";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    Solution solution;

    cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    solution.inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    solution.preorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    solution.postorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `TreeNode` represents each node in the binary tree, and `Solution` provides methods for traversing the tree in the three different orders. The `main` function creates a sample binary search tree and demonstrates each traversal method.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Valid binary search tree

To determine if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) in C++, you typically perform an in-order traversal of the tree and ensure that the elements are visited in sorted order. Here's how you can implement this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }
    
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
        if (!root) return true; // An empty tree is a valid BST

        // Check if the current node's value is within the valid range
        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal) return false;

        // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isValidBST(root))
        std::cout << "The binary tree is a valid binary search tree." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "The binary tree is not a valid binary search tree." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `isValidBST` function is called recursively to check if the current subtree is a valid BST.
- For each node, it checks if the node's value falls within a valid range defined by `minVal` and `maxVal`.
- Initially, the range is set to `LONG_MIN` and `LONG_MAX`, which are the minimum and maximum possible values for a long integer in C++, respectively.
- As you traverse down the tree, the range narrows down based on the value of the parent node.
- If any node's value violates the BST property (i.e., it's not within the valid range), the function returns false immediately.
- If the function completes the traversal without finding any violations, it returns true, indicating that the tree is a valid BST.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Valid binary search tree: Complexity analysis

Analyzing the complexity of validating a binary search tree (BST) involves considering both time and space complexities. Let's break it down:

1. **Time Complexity:**
    - **Traversing the Tree:** The algorithm typically involves traversing the entire binary tree to validate whether it satisfies the BST property.
        - For a balanced binary tree with 'n' nodes, the time complexity of traversing the tree is O(n).
        - In the worst case, if the tree is skewed (e.g., all nodes are on one side), the time complexity can be O(n), where 'n' is the number of nodes.
    - **Validation Check:** At each node, you check whether the node's value satisfies the BST property, comparing it with the values of its ancestors and descendants.
        - This comparison operation takes constant time, O(1).
        - Hence, for each node, the time complexity of validation is O(1).
    - **Overall Time Complexity:** Considering the traversal and validation at each node, the overall time complexity is O(n).

2. **Space Complexity:**
    - **Recursive Approach:** If you're using a recursive approach, the space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursive call stack.
        - In the worst case, the maximum depth of the call stack is equal to the height of the binary tree.
        - For a balanced binary tree, the height is O(log n), where 'n' is the number of nodes.
        - In the worst case (skewed tree), the height can be O(n).
        - Therefore, the space complexity of the recursive approach is O(log n) for a balanced tree and O(n) for a skewed tree.
    - **Iterative Approach:** If you're using an iterative approach, typically employing a stack or queue, the space complexity is determined by the size of the stack or queue.
        - In the worst case, when all nodes are on one side, the size of the stack or queue can be 'n'.
        - Therefore, the space complexity of the iterative approach is O(n).

In summary, the time complexity of validating a binary search tree is O(n), and the space complexity depends on the approach used: O(log n) for a balanced tree (recursive) and O(n) for a skewed tree (recursive or iterative).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Validate A Binary Search Trees

Validating a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ involves ensuring that for every node, its left child is less than the node, and its right child is greater than the node. Additionally, it must also ensure that the left and right subtrees are themselves valid BSTs.

Here's a C++ implementation using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }
    
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return true;
        
        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal)
            return false;
        
        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

// Utility function to create a new tree node
TreeNode* newNode(int data) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(data);
    return node;
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = newNode(2);
    root->left = newNode(1);
    root->right = newNode(3);
    
    if (solution.isValidBST(root))
        std::cout << "Valid BST\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Invalid BST\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `isValidBST` function is the main function that validates whether a given tree is a valid BST or not. It calls a helper function with the same name, which takes additional parameters `minVal` and `maxVal`. These parameters ensure that each node's value falls within an acceptable range.
- `isValidBST` checks if the current node's value is within the range defined by `minVal` and `maxVal`, and recursively validates its left and right subtrees by updating the range.
- `newNode` is a utility function to create a new tree node with a given value.

You can test this implementation with different trees to verify its correctness.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Validate Binary Search Tree

Validating a binary search tree (BST) involves ensuring that the tree adheres to the properties of a BST, namely that for every node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its value. Here's a C++ implementation to validate whether a given binary tree is a binary search tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }

private:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return true;

        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal)
            return false;

        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) &&
               isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    bool isValid = solution.isValidBST(root);
    std::cout << "Is the binary tree a valid BST? " << (isValid ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure for the nodes of the binary tree and a `Solution` class that contains the method `isValidBST`, which checks whether the given binary tree is a valid BST or not. The `isValidBST` function is called recursively with each node of the tree, along with the minimum and maximum values that its ancestors can take. If at any point the current node's value violates the BST property, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it continues to check its left and right subtrees recursively. If the function reaches the end of the tree without finding any violation, it returns `true`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Validate Binary Search Trees

To validate a binary search tree (BST) in C++, you typically traverse the tree and ensure that each node follows the rules of a BST, i.e., for every node, its left child should be less than the node, and its right child should be greater than the node. Additionally, all nodes in the left subtree should be less than the current node, and all nodes in the right subtree should be greater than the current node.

Here's a simple implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        return isValidBST(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }
    
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root, long minVal, long maxVal) {
        if (root == nullptr) return true;
        
        if (root->val <= minVal || root->val >= maxVal) return false;
        
        return isValidBST(root->left, minVal, root->val) && isValidBST(root->right, root->val, maxVal);
    }
};

// Utility function to create a new tree node
TreeNode* newNode(int data) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(data);
    node->left = nullptr;
    node->right = nullptr;
    return node;
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = newNode(2);
    root->left = newNode(1);
    root->right = newNode(3);

    if (solution.isValidBST(root))
        cout << "Valid BST" << endl;
    else
        cout << "Not a valid BST" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation defines a `TreeNode` structure and a `Solution` class with a `isValidBST` function that performs the validation. The `isValidBST` function takes the root node of the tree and two long integers `minVal` and `maxVal`, representing the range of valid values for the current node. The function recursively checks if the current node's value falls within this range and if the left and right subtrees are also valid BSTs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Validating a Binary Search Tree

Validating a binary search tree (BST) in C++ involves ensuring that the tree satisfies the properties of a BST, where for each node, the values in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and the values in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

Here's a simple approach to validate a BST:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        // Start with an initial lower bound of negative infinity and upper bound of positive infinity
        return validate(root, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
    }
    
    bool validate(TreeNode* node, long long lower, long long upper) {
        // Base case: an empty subtree is a valid BST
        if (node == nullptr)
            return true;
        
        // Check if the current node's value violates the BST property
        if (node->val <= lower || node->val >= upper)
            return false;
        
        // Recursively validate the left and right subtrees
        return validate(node->left, lower, node->val) && validate(node->right, node->val, upper);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isValidBST(root))
        std::cout << "Valid BST" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Not a valid BST" << std::endl;

    // Remember to free the memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure and a `Solution` class with a `isValidBST` method that takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns true if it is a valid BST, and false otherwise. The `validate` function recursively checks if each node satisfies the BST property within the given bounds. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this method.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is the Red-Black Tree?

A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It was invented by Rudolf Bayer and named after his colleague, Leo J. Guibas. Red-Black Trees maintain balance through a set of rules enforced during insertion and deletion operations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and guaranteeing relatively efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Here are the key properties of a Red-Black Tree:

1. **Binary Search Tree Property**: Like all binary search trees, a Red-Black Tree maintains the binary search tree property, meaning that for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

2. **Coloring**: Each node of the tree is assigned a color, either red or black.

3. **Root Property**: The root is always black.

4. **Red Property**: Red nodes cannot have red children. In other words, a red node cannot have a red parent or red children.

5. **Black Height Property**: The number of black nodes along any path from the root to a leaf (i.e., the black height) must be the same. This property ensures that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path.

By maintaining these properties, Red-Black Trees guarantee that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, ensuring that the tree remains balanced.

Operations like insertion, deletion, and search in Red-Black Trees have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because the tree is always balanced according to the defined properties. This makes Red-Black Trees particularly useful in scenarios where dynamic sets are needed, such as in implementing associative arrays, map data structures, and as the basis for many efficient algorithms and data structures in computer science.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Count of Smaller Numbers

Certainly! Counting the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in an array is a classic problem that can be solved using various algorithms and data structures in C++. Here's an outline of a solution using a Binary Search Tree (BST) approach:

#### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, for each element, count how many elements to its right are smaller than itself.

#### Example

**Input**: [5, 2, 6, 1]

**Output**: [2, 1, 1, 0]

#### Approach

We'll use a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) to efficiently count the number of smaller elements to the right of each element in the array. The basic idea is to traverse the array from right to left and for each element, insert it into the BST while keeping track of the number of elements that are smaller than the current element.

#### Detailed Steps

1. Traverse the array from right to left.
2. For each element:
   - Insert it into the BST.
   - Count the number of elements that are smaller than the current element.
3. Maintain a count of smaller elements and store it in an output array.
4. The insertion operation in the BST should be modified to count the number of smaller elements during the insertion process.

#### Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation of the described approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    int left_count;  // Number of nodes in the left subtree
    int count;  // Number of occurrences of the value
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int v) : val(v), left_count(0), count(1), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BST {
public:
    TreeNode* root;
    
    BST() : root(nullptr) {}
    
    int insert(int val) {
        return insert(root, val);
    }
    
private:
    int insert(TreeNode*& node, int val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            node = new TreeNode(val);
            return 0;
        }
        if (val < node->val) {
            node->left_count++;
            return insert(node->left, val);
        } else if (val > node->val) {
            return node->left_count + node->count + insert(node->right, val);
        } else {
            node->count++;
            return node->left_count;
        }
    }
};

std::vector<int> countSmaller(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n);
    BST bst;
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        result[i] = bst.insert(nums[i]);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {5, 2, 6, 1};
    std::vector<int> result = countSmaller(nums);
    
    for (int i : result) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation

- The `TreeNode` class represents a node in the BST, with additional fields to keep track of the count of nodes in the left subtree (`left_count`) and the count of occurrences of the node's value (`count`).
- The `BST` class manages the BST and provides an `insert` method which inserts a value into the BST and returns the count of smaller elements to the right of the current element.
- The `countSmaller` function processes the array from right to left, inserting each element into the BST and storing the count of smaller elements in the result array.

This approach ensures that each insertion operation in the BST runs in average O(log n) time, making the overall time complexity approximately O(n log n), which is efficient for this problem.

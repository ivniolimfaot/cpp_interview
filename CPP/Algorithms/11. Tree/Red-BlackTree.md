### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Creating Red-Black Tree similar to Creating 2-3-4 Tree

Creating a Red-Black Tree (RBT) in C++ involves similar principles to creating a 2-3-4 Tree in terms of maintaining balance and ensuring proper insertion, deletion, and traversal. However, the underlying structure and rules differ between the two.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach creating a Red-Black Tree in C++:

1. **Node Structure**: Define a node structure for the Red-Black Tree. Each node should store the key, value, color (red or black), pointers to left and right children, and the parent node.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int key;
    T value;
    bool is_red; // true if red, false if black
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* parent;
};
```

1. **Insertion**: Implement insertion algorithm to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties:

   - Perform a standard BST insertion.
   - Fix any violations of Red-Black Tree properties (e.g., red node cannot have a red parent, no two red nodes can appear consecutively).
   - Perform rotations and recoloring as necessary to restore balance.

1. **Deletion**: Implement deletion algorithm to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties:

   - Perform a standard BST deletion.
   - Fix any violations of Red-Black Tree properties.
   - Perform rotations and recoloring as necessary to restore balance.

1. **Rotations**: Implement left and right rotations to maintain balance during insertion and deletion. These rotations are similar to those used in AVL trees.

1. **Recoloring**: Implement rules for recoloring nodes during insertion and deletion to maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

1. **Traversal**: Implement inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal methods to traverse the Red-Black Tree.

1. **Search**: Implement a search algorithm to find a given key in the Red-Black Tree.

1. **Testing**: Write test cases to ensure that insertion, deletion, and other operations maintain the Red-Black Tree properties.

When creating a Red-Black Tree, it's essential to understand and adhere to the properties of a Red-Black Tree, such as the coloring rules and the rules for maintaining balance. Additionally, it's helpful to visualize the tree's structure during insertion and deletion to ensure correctness.

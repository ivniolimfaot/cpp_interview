### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Process For Solving Binary Tree Problems

Solving binary tree problems in C++ involves a systematic approach that combines understanding of algorithms, data structures, and the specific problem requirements. Here's a general process you can follow:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Carefully read and understand the problem statement. Identify what the problem is asking you to do with binary trees. Pay attention to any constraints or requirements mentioned.

2. **Review Binary Tree Basics**: Ensure you have a solid understanding of basic binary tree concepts such as nodes, edges, root, parent, children, height, depth, traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and properties (complete binary tree, full binary tree, balanced binary tree, etc.).

3. **Choose an Algorithmic Approach**: Based on the problem requirements, select the appropriate algorithmic approach. Common approaches for binary tree problems include traversal algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search), recursive algorithms, divide and conquer, and dynamic programming.

4. **Implement Binary Tree Data Structure**: If the problem doesn't provide a binary tree implementation, create one. Define a `TreeNode` struct/class representing a node in the binary tree, and optionally, a `BinaryTree` class to encapsulate tree operations.

5. **Write Helper Functions**: Depending on the problem, you may need helper functions to perform tasks such as tree traversal, node insertion, deletion, etc.

6. **Implement the Solution**: Use the chosen algorithmic approach to solve the problem. If you're using recursion, write a recursive function that operates on the binary tree. Ensure your solution handles edge cases and boundary conditions appropriately.

7. **Test Your Solution**: Write test cases to verify that your solution works correctly for different inputs and edge cases. Test for both correctness and efficiency.

8. **Analyze Time and Space Complexity**: Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution. Ensure it meets the problem's constraints and performance requirements.

9. **Optimize if Necessary**: If your initial solution is not optimal, think about ways to optimize it. This could involve reducing time complexity, space complexity, or improving the algorithm's efficiency.

10. **Document Your Code**: Write clear and concise comments to explain your code's logic, algorithms used, and any assumptions made. This will make your code more readable and understandable for others (and your future self).

11. **Review and Refactor**: Review your code for readability, efficiency, and maintainability. Refactor as needed to improve code quality.

12. **Submit and Discuss**: If the problem is part of an interview or competition, submit your solution and be prepared to discuss your approach and reasoning with others.

By following this process, you can effectively approach and solve binary tree problems in C++, ensuring your solutions are correct, efficient, and maintainable.

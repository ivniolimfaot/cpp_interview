### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structures: Trees

Sure, I can provide you with an overview of trees in the context of algorithms and data structures.

**Trees** are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each tree has a root node (the topmost node) and zero or more child nodes. Nodes are connected by edges. The node at the top is called the **root**, and nodes with no children are called **leaves**.

There are various types of trees, each with its own rules about how nodes are organized:

1. **Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than or equal to the node, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **Balanced Tree**: A balanced tree is a tree in which the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is not greater than a certain value, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and operations like search, insert, and delete have time complexity logarithmic in the number of nodes.

4. **AVL Tree**: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

5. **Red-Black Tree**: A red-black tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It ensures that the tree remains balanced by enforcing a set of properties on the tree nodes. These properties guarantee that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice the length of the shortest path.

6. **Heap**: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.

7. **Trie**: A trie, also called a prefix tree, is a tree data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings. Each node in a trie represents a common prefix of some keys, and the children of a node represent the different characters that can follow that prefix.

8. **N-ary Tree**: An n-ary tree is a tree in which each node can have at most n children. Binary trees are a special case of n-ary trees where n is 2.

These are some of the most commonly used types of trees in computer science and programming. Understanding trees and their properties is essential for implementing various algorithms efficiently, such as searching, sorting, and traversing data.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are trees ?

In computer science, a tree is a widely used data structure that resembles a hierarchical tree structure, consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value, and the edges represent the relationships between nodes. Trees are recursive data structures, meaning each node in a tree can itself be the root of a subtree.

Here are some key concepts associated with trees:

1. **Root**: The topmost node of the tree, which does not have any parent node. It is the starting point of the tree.

2. **Parent and Child Nodes**: Nodes in a tree are connected by edges. A node can be a parent to some nodes (its children) and a child of another node (its parent). Except for the root node, every node in a tree has exactly one parent.

3. **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes. They are the nodes at the bottom of the tree.

4. **Internal Nodes**: Nodes that have at least one child are called internal nodes. They are any nodes in the tree that are not leaf nodes.

5. **Subtree**: A subtree is a tree structure consisting of a node and all its descendants (children, grandchildren, and so on).

6. **Height**: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. It represents the maximum number of edges between the root and a leaf node.

7. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root node to that particular node.

8. **Binary Trees**: A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

9. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child of a node contains a value less than the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Trees are used in various applications such as representing hierarchical data (like file systems), organizing data for efficient searching (like in binary search trees), implementing advanced data structures (like heaps and AVL trees), and in algorithms such as traversal algorithms (like depth-first search and breadth-first search).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Editing Sorted Trees

Editing sorted trees in C++ typically involves operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching while maintaining the sorted order of the tree. One common data structure for this purpose is the binary search tree (BST). Here's a brief overview of how you can perform these operations:

1. **Insertion**:
   - To insert a new node into a BST while maintaining the sorted order, you start at the root and compare the value of the new node with the current node.
   - If the new node's value is less than the current node's value, you move to the left subtree; if it's greater, you move to the right subtree.
   - Repeat this process until you reach a leaf node (a node with no children) where the new node should be inserted. Then, insert the new node as a child of that leaf node.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Deleting a node from a BST while maintaining the sorted order requires special consideration to preserve the properties of a BST.
   - If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove it from the tree.
   - If the node has only one child, replace the node with its child.
   - If the node has two children, find the node with the next highest value (successor) in the tree (typically the leftmost node in the right subtree or the rightmost node in the left subtree).
   - Replace the node to be deleted with its successor, and then delete the successor node from its original location.

3. **Searching**:
   - Searching in a BST is straightforward. Start at the root and compare the target value with the value of the current node.
   - If the target value is equal to the current node's value, you've found the node.
   - If the target value is less than the current node's value, move to the left subtree.
   - If the target value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right subtree.
   - Repeat this process until you find the node or reach a leaf node (indicating the target value is not in the tree).

When implementing these operations, remember to consider edge cases such as handling duplicates (depending on the requirements of your application), handling empty trees, and ensuring proper memory management (e.g., deallocating memory for deleted nodes). Additionally, you might want to consider balancing techniques like AVL trees or Red-Black trees to maintain the tree's height balance, which can improve the efficiency of operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees Overview

In C++, trees are fundamental data structures used to store hierarchical data. They are widely used in computer science and are the basis for many other data structures and algorithms. Here's an overview of trees in C++:

#### 1. Binary Trees

- **Definition**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
- **Implementation**: In C++, a binary tree can be implemented using a structure or a class to represent each node, with pointers to the left and right children.
- **Operations**:

  - Searching

#### 2. Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **Operations**:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion

- **Operations**:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Searching
  - Traversal

#### 5. Trie (Prefix Tree)

- **Definition**: Trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings.
- **Operations**:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Searching
  - Prefix matching

#### 6. Segment Trees

- **Definition**: A segment tree is a tree data structure used to store information about intervals or segments.
- **Operations**:

#### 7. Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)

- **Definition**: Fenwick trees are a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.
- **Operations**:
  - Point updates
  - Range queries (prefix sum)

These are some of the key trees and tree-related data structures in C++. Understanding these data structures and algorithms associated with them is crucial for solving various programming problems efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): 2-3 Trees

2-3 trees are balanced search trees that provide efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations. They are a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node can contain either one or two keys and has two or three children nodes.

Here's a brief overview of the properties and operations of 2-3 trees:

#### Properties

1. **Binary Search Tree Property**: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key, and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key.
2. **Balanced Structure**: All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring a balanced tree.
3. **Node Structure**:
   - Each node can have either one key and two children or two keys and three children.
   - For a node with one key, it has two child nodes.
   - For a node with two keys, it has three child nodes.

#### Operations

1. **Insertion**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree to find the appropriate leaf node for insertion.
   - If the leaf node has only one key, insert the new key into it.
   - If the leaf node has two keys, split the node into three and promote the middle key to its parent.
   - Continue splitting and promoting keys upwards until the tree's balance is restored.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree to find the node containing the key to be deleted.
   - If the node is a leaf node, simply remove the key from it.
   - If the node is an internal node, replace the key to be deleted with its predecessor or successor, then delete the predecessor or successor from its appropriate leaf node.
   - If necessary, perform rotations or merges to maintain the properties of the 2-3 tree.

3. **Search**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree, comparing the search key with the keys in each node.
   - If the key is found, return the corresponding value.
   - If the key is not found, continue searching in the appropriate subtree until a leaf node is reached.

#### C++ Implementation

```cpp
// Node structure for 2-3 tree
struct Node {
    int key1;
    int key2;
    Node* child1;
    Node* child2;
    Node* child3;
    bool isTwoNode; // true if node has one key, false if node has two keys
};

class TwoThreeTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper functions for insertion, deletion, and search

public:
    TwoThreeTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function declarations for insertion, deletion, and search
};
```

Implementing 2-3 trees in C++ involves managing the node structure and implementing the insertion, deletion, and search algorithms while maintaining the balance and properties of the tree. These operations can be a bit complex due to the need for node splitting, merging, and promotions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): 2-3-4 Trees

2-3-4 trees are a type of self-balancing search tree where each node can have 2, 3, or 4 child nodes. They are similar to red-black trees but are more generalized and can hold more keys per node.

In a 2-3-4 tree:

1. **Node Structure**: Each node can hold 1, 2, or 3 keys and 2, 3, or 4 child pointers respectively.
2. **Balanced Structure**: All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring a balanced tree.
3. **Search Operation**: Searching for an element in a 2-3-4 tree follows the same principles as in a binary search tree. You compare the search key with the keys in the nodes, and based on the comparison, you traverse either the left or right child subtree.
4. **Insertion Operation**: Insertion in a 2-3-4 tree involves finding the appropriate leaf node for the new key and then inserting it into that node. If the node becomes overfull (i.e., has more than 3 keys after insertion), it splits into two nodes, and the middle key is moved up to the parent node. This process may propagate up the tree if necessary.
5. **Deletion Operation**: Deleting a key from a 2-3-4 tree involves similar steps to insertion. If a node becomes underfull after deletion (i.e., has fewer than 2 keys), it may borrow a key from a sibling node or merge with a sibling node, redistributing keys appropriately.
6. **Splitting and Merging**: When a node splits, the middle key moves up to the parent node, and the remaining keys form two new nodes. When merging nodes, a key from the parent node moves down to the merged node, and the two nodes combine to form a single node.
7. **Complexity**: The height of a balanced 2-3-4 tree containing \( n \) keys is \( O(\log n) \), resulting in efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Implementing a 2-3-4 tree involves handling various cases during insertion and deletion to maintain the properties of the tree. It's slightly more complex compared to binary search trees but offers better balance and guarantees logarithmic time complexity for operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Decision Trees

Decision trees are a fundamental concept in both machine learning and computer science. They are versatile tools used for classification and regression tasks, among others. Here's an overview of decision trees in the context of algorithms and data structures in C++:

### Decision Tree Structure

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a decision tree contains:
   - A decision (or split) based on a feature.
   - References (pointers or indices) to child nodes.

2. **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes that represent the output (classification or regression result).

### Construction of Decision Trees

1. **Splitting Criteria**:
   - Choose the best feature to split on at each node. Common criteria include Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain for classification; mean squared error reduction for regression.

2. **Stopping Criteria**:
   - Define conditions to stop splitting, like maximum tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, or minimum impurity decrease.

3. **Recursive Splitting**:
   - Recursively split the dataset based on selected features until stopping criteria are met.

### Key Operations

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Build the decision tree by recursively selecting the best split at each node until termination conditions are satisfied.

2. **Prediction**:
   - Traverse the decision tree based on input features until reaching a leaf node, then return the output.

### Implementation in C++

1. **Node Structure**: Define a struct or class representing each node, storing feature index, split value, pointers to child nodes, and output value for leaf nodes.

2. **Construction Functions**: Write functions to recursively construct the decision tree by selecting the best split and partitioning the dataset.

3. **Prediction Function**: Implement a function to traverse the decision tree based on input features and return the predicted output.

4. **Stopping Conditions**: Define conditions to stop splitting and convert a node into a leaf node.

5. **Splitting Criteria**: Implement functions to calculate impurity measures and select the best split.

### Libraries

While you can implement decision trees from scratch, many C++ libraries offer efficient implementations, such as:

- **MLPACK**: Provides decision tree functionality along with other machine learning algorithms.
- **Dlib**: Includes a decision tree implementation among its various machine learning tools.
- **Scikit-Learn (with C++ Interface)**: Utilize the C++ interface of Scikit-Learn, a popular Python library, for decision tree functionality.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Define Node structure
struct Node {
    int featureIndex;
    double splitValue;
    std::vector<Node*> children;
    double output; // For leaf nodes
};

// Function to build decision tree
Node* buildDecisionTree(std::vector<std::vector<double>>& data) {
    // Implement tree construction logic here
}

// Function to make predictions
double predict(Node* root, std::vector<double>& input) {
    // Implement prediction logic here
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    // Define dataset
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> data = {{2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0}, /*...*/};
    
    // Build decision tree
    Node* root = buildDecisionTree(data);
    
    // Make predictions
    std::vector<double> input = {1.0, 2.0};
    double prediction = predict(root, input);
    
    std::cout << "Prediction: " << prediction << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, you'd implement the `buildDecisionTree` function to construct the decision tree and the `predict` function to traverse the tree for predictions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Analysis of n-Ary Trees

Analyzing n-ary trees involves examining their properties, operations, and complexities. An n-ary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node can have at most n children. Analyzing n-ary trees often involves understanding various operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal, along with their associated time complexities.

Let's dive into the analysis of n-ary trees:

#### Properties of n-ary Trees

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in an n-ary tree typically contains a key or value and pointers/references to its children nodes.
2. **Root**: The topmost node in the tree.
3. **Parent & Child Relationship**: Each node has at most n children, forming a parent-child relationship.
4. **Height**: The height of an n-ary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
5. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node.
6. **Degree**: Maximum number of children a node can have, which is 'n' in the case of an n-ary tree.

#### Operations and Time Complexities

1. **Insertion**: Inserting a node into an n-ary tree can be done by finding the appropriate parent node and adding the new node as its child. The time complexity depends on the tree's structure and insertion position. In the worst-case scenario, it can be O(n) if the tree is skewed.

2. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from an n-ary tree involves finding the node to be deleted and removing its reference from its parent's child list. Similar to insertion, the time complexity can be O(n) in the worst case.

3. **Searching**: Searching for a node in an n-ary tree involves traversing the tree. In the worst case, where the node is at the bottom-right corner of the tree, the time complexity is O(n).

4. **Traversal**:
   - **Depth-First Traversals**: Depth-first traversal methods like Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals can be applied to n-ary trees. They have a time complexity of O(n).
   - **Breadth-First Traversal**: Breadth-first traversal (Level-order traversal) involves visiting all nodes of a level before proceeding to the next level. It also has a time complexity of O(n).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of n-ary trees mainly depends on the maximum number of nodes at any level. In the worst case, where the tree is complete, the space complexity is O(n).

#### Applications

n-ary trees are used in various applications, including file systems, organization hierarchies, syntax trees in compiler design, and more. Their flexible structure makes them suitable for representing hierarchical data.

Understanding the properties and operations of n-ary trees is essential for designing efficient algorithms and data structures in scenarios where hierarchical data needs to be managed and processed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Building a Tree

Sure! Building a tree in C++ involves defining a structure for a tree node and then implementing functions to manipulate and construct the tree. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure for a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to insert a node into the tree
void insert(TreeNode* root, int parentVal, int childVal) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    if (root->val == parentVal) {
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(childVal);
        root->children.push_back(newNode);
    } else {
        for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
            insert(child, parentVal, childVal);
        }
    }
}

// Function to print the tree in preorder traversal
void printPreorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    cout << root->val << " ";
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        printPreorder(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create the root node
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);

    // Insert nodes into the tree
    insert(root, 1, 2);
    insert(root, 1, 3);
    insert(root, 1, 4);
    insert(root, 2, 5);
    insert(root, 2, 6);

    // Print the tree
    cout << "Preorder traversal of the tree: ";
    printPreorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents each node of the tree. It contains the node's value (`val`) and a vector of pointers to its children.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node with the given value as a child of the node with the given parent value.
- The `printPreorder` function performs a preorder traversal of the tree and prints the values of the nodes.
- In the `main` function, a tree is created with a root node having a value of 1, and nodes are inserted into the tree accordingly.
- Finally, the preorder traversal of the tree is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Cartesian Tree

A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers. Each node in the Cartesian Tree represents an element from the sequence, and the tree has the property that the parent of any node \( N \) in the tree has a value greater than \( N \)'s value and is closest to \( N \) in the left side of the sequence. In other words, it's a binary tree representation of the given sequence with a heap property.

Here's how you can construct a Cartesian Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
    TreeNode(int val) : value(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* constructCartesianTree(const vector<int>& arr) {
    stack<TreeNode*> stk;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        TreeNode* current = new TreeNode(arr[i]);

        while (!stk.empty() && stk.top()->value > arr[i]) {
            current->left = stk.top();
            stk.pop();
        }

        if (!stk.empty()) {
            stk.top()->right = current;
        }

        stk.push(current);
    }

    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    while (!stk.empty()) {
        root = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
    }

    return root;
}

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->value << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {3, 2, 6, 1, 9, 5, 7};
    TreeNode* root = constructCartesianTree(arr);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed Cartesian Tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code constructs a Cartesian Tree from a given sequence represented by a vector of integers. It uses a stack to efficiently keep track of the current subtree being constructed. Finally, it returns the root of the constructed Cartesian Tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Tree from PostOrder and Inorder Traversal

Constructing a binary tree from its inorder and postorder traversals is a classic problem in computer science. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder) {
        // Create a map to store the indices of elements in inorder traversal for quick lookup
        unordered_map<int, int> inorder_map;
        for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
            inorder_map[inorder[i]] = i;
        }
        // Start the recursive construction
        return buildTreeHelper(inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1, postorder, 0, postorder.size() - 1, inorder_map);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& inorder, int inStart, int inEnd,
                              vector<int>& postorder, int postStart, int postEnd,
                              unordered_map<int, int>& inorder_map) {
        if (inStart > inEnd || postStart > postEnd) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // The last element of postorder is the root
        int rootVal = postorder[postEnd];
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
        
        // Find the index of root in inorder traversal
        int rootIndexInorder = inorder_map[rootVal];
        
        // Calculate the size of left subtree
        int leftSubtreeSize = rootIndexInorder - inStart;
        
        // Recursively build left and right subtrees
        root->left = buildTreeHelper(inorder, inStart, rootIndexInorder - 1,
                                     postorder, postStart, postStart + leftSubtreeSize - 1,
                                     inorder_map);
        root->right = buildTreeHelper(inorder, rootIndexInorder + 1, inEnd,
                                      postorder, postStart + leftSubtreeSize, postEnd - 1,
                                      inorder_map);
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Utility function to print the inorder traversal of a binary tree
void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    printInorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    printInorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};
    vector<int> postorder = {9, 15, 7, 20, 3};
    
    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* root = sol.buildTree(inorder, postorder);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a `buildTree` method that takes the inorder and postorder traversal arrays as input and returns the root of the constructed binary tree. The `buildTreeHelper` method is a recursive helper function to construct the tree. Finally, there's a `printInorder` function to print the inorder traversal of the constructed tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Tree from PreOrder and Inorder Traversal

Constructing a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals is a classic problem in computer science and is commonly solved using recursion. Here's a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        unordered_map<int, int> inorder_map;
        for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
            inorder_map[inorder[i]] = i;
        }
        return buildTreeHelper(preorder, 0, preorder.size() - 1, inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1, inorder_map);
    }
    
    TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& preorder, int preStart, int preEnd, vector<int>& inorder, int inStart, int inEnd, unordered_map<int, int>& inorder_map) {
        if (preStart > preEnd || inStart > inEnd) return nullptr;
        
        int rootVal = preorder[preStart];
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
        
        int rootIndexInorder = inorder_map[rootVal];
        int leftSubtreeSize = rootIndexInorder - inStart;
        
        root->left = buildTreeHelper(preorder, preStart + 1, preStart + leftSubtreeSize, inorder, inStart, rootIndexInorder - 1, inorder_map);
        root->right = buildTreeHelper(preorder, preStart + leftSubtreeSize + 1, preEnd, inorder, rootIndexInorder + 1, inEnd, inorder_map);
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Function to print the inorder traversal of a binary tree
void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> preorder = {3, 9, 20, 15, 7};
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};
    
    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* root = solution.buildTree(preorder, inorder);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a helper function `buildTreeHelper` to recursively construct the tree. It also utilizes a hashmap to store the indices of elements in the inorder traversal for efficient lookup during tree construction. Finally, it provides a simple main function to demonstrate the usage of the `buildTree` function and prints the inorder traversal of the constructed tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Constructing and Evaluating an Expression Tree

Constructing and evaluating an expression tree in C++ involves parsing an infix expression, converting it to a postfix expression, building the expression tree, and then evaluating the tree. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Parsing Infix Expression**:
   - Parse the infix expression into tokens (operands, operators, parentheses).
   - Use a stack to handle precedence and parentheses.

2. **Converting to Postfix Expression**:
   - Use the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix expression to postfix.
   - Maintain a stack to store operators temporarily.

3. **Building the Expression Tree**:
   - Traverse the postfix expression.
   - For each token:
     - If it's an operand, create a leaf node and push it onto the stack.
     - If it's an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, create a new node with the operator as its value, and push it back onto the stack.

4. **Evaluating the Expression Tree**:
   - Use recursive traversal (post-order traversal) to evaluate the expression tree.
   - For each node:
     - If it's an operand, return its value.
     - If it's an operator, apply the operator to the values of its children.

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    string data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(string val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool isOperator(char c) {
    return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
}

int precedence(char op) {
    if (op == '+' || op == '-')
        return 1;
    if (op == '*' || op == '/')
        return 2;
    return 0;
}

TreeNode* buildExpressionTree(const string& postfix) {
    stack<TreeNode*> st;
    for (char c : postfix) {
        if (isspace(c))
            continue;
        if (isalnum(c)) {
            st.push(new TreeNode(string(1, c)));
        } else if (isOperator(c)) {
            TreeNode* right = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* left = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            root->left = left;
            root->right = right;
            st.push(root);
        }
    }
    return st.top();
}

int evaluate(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return 0;
    if (root->data.length() == 1 && isOperator(root->data[0])) {
        int leftVal = evaluate(root->left);
        int rightVal = evaluate(root->right);
        switch (root->data[0]) {
            case '+': return leftVal + rightVal;
            case '-': return leftVal - rightVal;
            case '*': return leftVal * rightVal;
            case '/': return leftVal / rightVal;
        }
    }
    return stoi(root->data);
}

int main() {
    string infix = "5 + (3 * 4)";
    string postfix;
    stack<char> operators;
    for (char c : infix) {
        if (isspace(c))
            continue;
        if (isdigit(c)) {
            postfix += c;
        } else if (c == '(') {
            operators.push(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            while (!operators.empty() && operators.top() != '(') {
                postfix += operators.top();
                operators.pop();
            }
            operators.pop(); // Remove '('
        } else if (isOperator(c)) {
            while (!operators.empty() && precedence(operators.top()) >= precedence(c)) {
                postfix += operators.top();
                operators.pop();
            }
            operators.push(c);
        }
    }
    while (!operators.empty()) {
        postfix += operators.top();
        operators.pop();
    }
    TreeNode* root = buildExpressionTree(postfix);
    cout << "Postfix: " << postfix << endl;
    cout << "Result: " << evaluate(root) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation can handle basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses. You can extend it to support more operators or functions if needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Counting Trees

Counting trees in computer science often involves understanding different types of tree structures and their properties. In C++, you can implement algorithms to count various aspects of trees, such as the number of nodes, the height of the tree, or the number of different types of trees in a given structure.

Here's a simple example of how you can count the number of nodes in a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to count the number of nodes in a binary tree
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Count the number of nodes
    int numNodes = countNodes(root);
    std::cout << "Number of nodes in the binary tree: " << numNodes << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `countNodes` function recursively counts the number of nodes in the binary tree. We start from the root node and recursively count the nodes in the left subtree and the right subtree, adding 1 for the current node.

This is just a basic example, and there are many other operations and properties you can compute for trees in C++, depending on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Counting Trees Bottom Up

Counting trees bottom-up typically involves dynamic programming. You start from the simplest case and build up towards the desired solution. In the context of counting trees, this often means starting with the base cases (e.g., when there are no nodes or just one node) and then incrementally adding nodes to generate larger trees.

Here's a basic approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to count the number of unique binary trees with n nodes
int countTrees(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1;

    vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of nodes in the binary tree: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Number of unique binary trees with " << n << " nodes: " << countTrees(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `countTrees(n)` calculates the number of unique binary trees with `n` nodes.
- We use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique binary trees with `i` nodes.
- The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, and for each `i`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the previously calculated values in `dp`.
- The formula `dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1]` calculates the number of trees when `j` nodes are on the left subtree and `i - j - 1` nodes are on the right subtree, considering all possible values of `j`.
- Finally, `dp[n]` gives us the answer for `n` nodes.

This approach ensures that we don't recalculate the number of unique trees for the same number of nodes, thereby optimizing the solution.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : Generic Trees

In C++, generic trees are structures where each node can have an arbitrary number of children. Unlike binary trees where each node has at most two children, generic trees allow nodes to have multiple children. Here's a basic implementation of a generic tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the generic tree
template<typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(T val) : data(val) {}
};

// Generic tree class
template<typename T>
class GenericTree {
private:
    TreeNode<T>* root;

public:
    GenericTree(T val) {
        root = new TreeNode<T>(val);
    }

    // Function to insert a new node as a child of a given node
    void insert(TreeNode<T>* parent, T val) {
        TreeNode<T>* newNode = new TreeNode<T>(val);
        parent->children.push_back(newNode);
    }

    // Function to print the tree (Depth-First Traversal)
    void print(TreeNode<T>* node, int depth = 0) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        // Print the current node
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; ++i)
            cout << "  ";
        cout << node->data << endl;

        // Recursively print children
        for (TreeNode<T>* child : node->children)
            print(child, depth + 1);
    }

    // Wrapper function to print the entire tree
    void print() {
        print(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a generic tree
    GenericTree<int> tree(1);
    TreeNode<int>* root = tree.root;

    // Insert some nodes
    tree.insert(root, 2);
    tree.insert(root, 3);
    tree.insert(root->children[0], 4);
    tree.insert(root->children[1], 5);
    tree.insert(root->children[1], 6);

    // Print the tree
    tree.print();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and a `GenericTree` class. Each node has a data field and a vector to store its children. The `insert` function inserts a new node as a child of a given parent node. The `print` function performs a Depth-First Traversal to print the tree structure. Finally, in the `main` function, a simple example of a generic tree is created and printed.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Degree of Node and Tree

In algorithms and data structures, the degree of a node refers to the number of edges incident to that node. For a tree, which is a special kind of graph with no cycles, the degree of a node is crucial in understanding its structure and properties.

In the context of a tree:

1. **Degree of a Node**: The degree of a node in a tree is the number of children it has. For a binary tree, a node can have at most two children, so the degree of a node in a binary tree is either 0, 1, or 2.

2. **Degree of a Tree**: The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of its nodes. In a binary tree, for example, the maximum degree is 2 because each node can have at most two children.

Here's a brief example of how you might implement these concepts in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a Node in a binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to calculate the degree of a node
int nodeDegree(TreeNode* node) {
    if (node == nullptr)
        return 0;
    int degree = 0;
    if (node->left != nullptr)
        degree++;
    if (node->right != nullptr)
        degree++;
    return degree;
}

// Function to calculate the degree of a tree
int treeDegree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    int maxDegree = nodeDegree(root);
    if (root->left != nullptr) {
        int leftDegree = treeDegree(root->left);
        maxDegree = max(maxDegree, leftDegree);
    }
    if (root->right != nullptr) {
        int rightDegree = treeDegree(root->right);
        maxDegree = max(maxDegree, rightDegree);
    }
    return maxDegree;
}

int main() {
    // Example of a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Degree of node 1: " << nodeDegree(root) << endl;
    cout << "Degree of tree: " << treeDegree(root) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `nodeDegree` calculates the degree of a node, and `treeDegree` calculates the degree of the entire tree. The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree, with each node having a value and pointers to its left and right children.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Depth First Search on Trees

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used to traverse or search through tree and graph data structures. In the context of trees, DFS starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here's an example implementation of DFS on a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BinaryTree {
public:
    // Function to perform DFS recursively
    void dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        // Process the current node
        cout << node->val << " ";

        // Recursive call for left and right subtrees
        dfs(node->left);
        dfs(node->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    BinaryTree bt;
    cout << "Depth First Search traversal of the binary tree: ";
    bt.dfs(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // This step is crucial to prevent memory leaks
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `dfs()` is a recursive function that traverses the binary tree in DFS fashion. It prints the value of each node as it visits them. The `main()` function creates a binary tree and calls `dfs()` on its root node to perform DFS traversal.

Remember to properly deallocate memory allocated for tree nodes after using them to avoid memory leaks.

This code demonstrates a simple implementation of DFS on a binary tree. You can modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as handling different types of trees or performing additional operations during traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Depth First Search Tree and Backedges

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's commonly used to traverse or search through graph or tree structures. In the context of trees, DFS helps in traversing and exploring all the nodes of a tree.

Here's a basic implementation of DFS for traversing a tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    vector<Node*> children;
    Node(int value) : data(value) {}
};

// Depth First Search function
void DFS(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    
    cout << root->data << " "; // Process the current node
    
    // Traverse all the children of the current node recursively
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        DFS(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));

    cout << "DFS Traversal of the tree: ";
    DFS(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `Node` structure to represent each node of the tree. Each node has an integer value and a vector of child nodes.
- The `DFS` function traverses the tree recursively. It starts from the root node and explores each child node in depth-first manner.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample tree and call the `DFS` function to traverse it.

Now, about backedges in DFS: In a DFS traversal, a backedge is an edge that connects a node to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree. These edges indicate the existence of a cycle in the graph or tree.

To detect backedges during DFS traversal, you can maintain additional information such as the traversal state of each node (e.g., whether a node is being visited, visited, or unvisited). When traversing an edge `(u, v)` from node `u` to node `v`, if `v` is already being visited (indicating it's in the current DFS path), and `v` is not the parent of `u`, then `(u, v)` is a backedge.

You can modify the DFS function to detect backedges by incorporating such logic. If you need more specific guidance on detecting backedges or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Depth First Search Trees and Backedges

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. In the context of trees, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This approach is often implemented using recursion.

In C++, you can represent a basic tree using a structure or a class. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    vector<Node*> children;
    Node(int val) : data(val) {}
};

void dfs(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    cout << root->data << " ";
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        dfs(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(new Node(6));

    cout << "DFS Traversal: ";
    dfs(root);

    return 0;
}
```

In DFS, backedges refer to the edges that connect a node to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree. Detecting backedges is essential in certain applications, such as cycle detection in graphs. In tree traversal, you typically won't have backedges, as trees don't contain cycles by definition. However, in a general graph traversal, you can encounter backedges.

Here's how you can modify the DFS function to detect backedges in a graph represented by an adjacency list:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int node, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& parent) {
    visited[node] = true;
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            parent[neighbor] = node;
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited, parent);
        } else if (parent[node] != neighbor) {
            cout << "Backedge detected between " << node << " and " << neighbor << endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    graph[0].push_back(1);
    graph[1].push_back(2);
    graph[2].push_back(3);
    graph[3].push_back(4);
    graph[4].push_back(5);
    graph[5].push_back(2); // introducing a backedge

    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    vector<int> parent(n, -1);

    cout << "Backedges: " << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(graph, i, visited, parent);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the graph is represented using an adjacency list. The `parent` vector keeps track of the parent of each node in the DFS traversal. If a visited neighbor is encountered that is not the parent of the current node, it indicates the presence of a backedge.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): difference Height Level Depth tree

In the context of trees, particularly in computer science and programming, the terms "height," "level," and "depth" refer to different characteristics of the tree structure. Let's break down each term:

1. **Height of a Tree:**
   - The height of a tree is the maximum distance from the root node to any leaf node in the tree.
   - In other words, it's the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
   - For example, in a binary tree, the height is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf.

2. **Level of a Node:**
   - The level of a node in a tree is its distance from the root node.
   - The root node is considered to be at level 0, and its immediate children are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.
   - For example, nodes at the same depth (or distance from the root) have the same level.

3. **Depth of a Node:**
   - The depth of a node is the distance from the root of the tree to that particular node.
   - Unlike the level, which refers to the position of a node relative to the root, depth is an absolute measure.
   - The root node has a depth of 0, its children have a depth of 1, their children have a depth of 2, and so on.

In summary, while height refers to the overall size of the tree, level and depth refer to characteristics of individual nodes within the tree. Height measures the longest path from the root to a leaf, level measures the distance of a node from the root, and depth measures the distance of a node from the root along the path to that node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Distance Tree

A "Distance Tree" isn't a standard term in the realm of algorithms and data structures, but I can offer some insights on what it might refer to based on common concepts.

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   A minimum spanning tree is a tree that spans all the vertices of a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight. This tree minimizes the total cost of the edges while connecting all the vertices. Algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's can be used to find the minimum spanning tree.

2. **Shortest Path Tree**:
   This could refer to a tree structure derived from a graph where each node represents a vertex and each edge represents a shortest path between two vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to find shortest paths and then construct such a tree.

3. **Bounded-Distance Tree**:
   In this concept, you might construct a tree such that the maximum distance between any two nodes in the tree is bounded by a certain value. This could be useful in various network routing or clustering algorithms.

4. **Distance Oracles**:
   A distance oracle is a data structure designed to quickly answer distance queries in a graph. It precomputes and stores information about distances between pairs of vertices, allowing fast retrieval of distances during query time.

5. **Hierarchical Clustering Tree**:
   In hierarchical clustering, a distance tree can be constructed where the nodes represent clusters at various levels of similarity, and the edges represent the distance between these clusters.

If you provide more context or details, I can offer a more specific explanation or implementation in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Expression Tree

An Expression Tree is a specific type of binary tree used to represent expressions. Each node in the tree represents either an operand or an operator. Here's how you can implement an Expression Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Node definition for the Expression Tree
struct TreeNode {
    string value;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(string val) : value(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to check if a given character is an operator
bool isOperator(char c) {
    return (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/');
}

// Function to construct Expression Tree from postfix expression
TreeNode* constructExpressionTree(string postfix) {
    stack<TreeNode*> stack;
    
    for (char c : postfix) {
        if (!isOperator(c)) {
            TreeNode* operandNode = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            stack.push(operandNode);
        } else {
            TreeNode* rightOperand = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            TreeNode* leftOperand = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            
            TreeNode* operatorNode = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            operatorNode->left = leftOperand;
            operatorNode->right = rightOperand;
            
            stack.push(operatorNode);
        }
    }
    
    return stack.top();
}

// Function to evaluate Expression Tree recursively
int evaluateExpressionTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return 0;
    if (!root->left && !root->right)
        return stoi(root->value);
    
    int leftVal = evaluateExpressionTree(root->left);
    int rightVal = evaluateExpressionTree(root->right);
    
    if (root->value == "+")
        return leftVal + rightVal;
    else if (root->value == "-")
        return leftVal - rightVal;
    else if (root->value == "*")
        return leftVal * rightVal;
    else
        return leftVal / rightVal;
}

int main() {
    string postfixExpression = "34*2+";
    
    TreeNode* root = constructExpressionTree(postfixExpression);
    
    cout << "Evaluation of the expression tree: " << evaluateExpressionTree(root) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the structure of a TreeNode, which holds a string value representing either an operand or an operator. The `constructExpressionTree` function constructs the expression tree from a postfix expression, and the `evaluateExpressionTree` function recursively evaluates the expression tree. Finally, the `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions by constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression and evaluating it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Expression Trees

Expression trees are a fundamental data structure used in computer science, particularly in the realm of compilers, parsing, and evaluation of mathematical expressions. In C++, you can implement expression trees using object-oriented programming principles. Here's a basic overview and implementation:

1. **Node Structure**: Define a structure/class to represent nodes in the expression tree. Each node will contain either an operand (like a number or a variable) or an operator.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    char data; // For simplicity, assuming operators are characters
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    // Constructor for operator node
    TreeNode(char data) : data(data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    
    // Constructor for operand node
    TreeNode(int data) : data(data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

1. **Building the Tree**: Parse the expression (in postfix, prefix, or infix notation) and construct the expression tree accordingly.

```cpp
TreeNode* buildExpressionTree(string postfix) {
    stack<TreeNode*> st;
    for (char ch : postfix) {
        if (isOperand(ch)) {
            st.push(new TreeNode(ch));
        } else {
            TreeNode* op2 = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* op1 = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(ch);
            newNode->left = op1;
            newNode->right = op2;
            st.push(newNode);
        }
    }
    return st.top();
}
```

1. **Evaluation**: Once the expression tree is constructed, you can evaluate the expression recursively.

```cpp
int evaluate(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    if (isOperand(root->data)) {
        return root->data - '0'; // Assuming operands are single digits
    }
    int left_val = evaluate(root->left);
    int right_val = evaluate(root->right);
    switch (root->data) {
        case '+': return left_val + right_val;
        case '-': return left_val - right_val;
        case '*': return left_val * right_val;
        case '/': return left_val / right_val;
        default: return 0;
    }
}
```

1. **Traversal**: You can traverse the expression tree in various orders: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder.

```cpp
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}
```

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might need to handle more complex expressions, error checking, and additional functionalities.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Fenwick Trees

Fenwick trees, also known as Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), are a data structure that efficiently supports two operations on an array of numbers:

1. **Point Update**: Modify the value of an element at a specific index.
2. **Range Query**: Compute the prefix sum of elements up to a specific index.

Here's how they work:

#### Structure

A Fenwick tree is represented as an array `BIT[]` of the same size as the original array. Each element `BIT[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements in the original array.

#### Construction

To construct a Fenwick tree for an array `arr[]`, we start with an array initialized with all zeroes. Then, we update the Fenwick tree by adding each element of `arr[]` to its corresponding range in the tree. The update operation for element `arr[i]` at index `i` involves updating `BIT[j]` for all `j` such that `j` is formed by flipping the least significant bit of `i`. This is done by adding `arr[i]` to `BIT[j]`.

#### Update Operation

To update the value of an element `arr[i]` in the original array, we update the Fenwick tree as follows:

```cpp
void update(int index, int value) {
    while (index <= n) {
        BIT[index] += value;
        index += (index & -index); // Move to the next node
    }
}
```

#### Query Operation

To compute the prefix sum up to index `idx`, we traverse the Fenwick tree, adding up the values of all nodes that contribute to the sum:

```cpp
int query(int idx) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (idx > 0) {
        sum += BIT[idx];
        idx -= (idx & -idx); // Move to the parent node
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Example Usage

Let's say we have an array `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. The Fenwick tree for this array would be `BIT[] = {0, 1, 3, 3, 10, 5}`.

#### Update

To update `arr[2]` to `6`, we call `update(2, 3)`. This would result in `BIT[] = {0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 5}`.

#### Query

To find the sum of elements up to index `4`, we call `query(4)`, which returns `10`.

Fenwick trees are efficient and have a time complexity of O(log n) for both update and query operations, where n is the size of the array. They are particularly useful when the number of updates and queries is dynamic and unpredictable.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Find Bottom Left Tree Value

To find the bottom-left value of a binary tree in C++, you can perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first search) and return the leftmost value of the last level encountered. Here's a sample implementation using a queue for level-order traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int leftmost = root->val;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        leftmost = q.front()->val; // Update leftmost with the current level's leftmost node
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return leftmost;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    cout << "Bottom left value: " << findBottomLeftValue(root) << endl;

    // Remember to free the dynamically allocated memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `findBottomLeftValue` function takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the value of the bottom-left node.
- We perform a level-order traversal using a queue. We traverse each level from left to right and update the `leftmost` variable with the leftmost node of each level.
- Finally, we return the `leftmost` value, which holds the value of the bottom-left node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Finding Nodes Trees

Sure, I can help you with that! In C++, you can implement algorithms to find nodes in trees using various traversal techniques like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here's a basic example of how you can find a node in a binary tree using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Depth First Search (DFS) to find a node in a binary tree
TreeNode* findNodeDFS(TreeNode* root, int target) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

    if (root->val == target) return root;

    TreeNode* leftResult = findNodeDFS(root->left, target);
    if (leftResult != nullptr) return leftResult;

    TreeNode* rightResult = findNodeDFS(root->right, target);
    if (rightResult != nullptr) return rightResult;

    return nullptr;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    int target = 5;
    TreeNode* result = findNodeDFS(root, target);

    if (result != nullptr) {
        cout << "Node with value " << target << " found in the tree." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Node with value " << target << " not found in the tree." << endl;
    }

    // Free memory (not necessary in some environments)
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `findNodeDFS` is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search traversal of the binary tree. It returns a pointer to the node with the given value if found, otherwise, it returns `nullptr`. You can modify this function according to your tree structure and search requirements.

Remember to handle memory deallocation properly, especially if you're dynamically allocating memory for tree nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Generating Tree from Traversals

Generating a tree from its traversals, especially in the context of binary trees, typically involves using the inorder and preorder traversals. These traversals provide information about the order in which nodes are visited during tree traversal. Here's a high-level overview of how you can generate a binary tree from its inorder and preorder traversals in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder, int preorderStart, int preorderEnd, int inorderStart, int inorderEnd, unordered_map<int, int>& inorderMap) {
    if (preorderStart > preorderEnd || inorderStart > inorderEnd) return nullptr;

    int rootValue = preorder[preorderStart];
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootValue);

    int rootIndexInInorder = inorderMap[rootValue];
    int numsLeft = rootIndexInInorder - inorderStart;

    root->left = buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, preorderStart + 1, preorderStart + numsLeft, inorderStart, rootIndexInInorder - 1, inorderMap);
    root->right = buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, preorderStart + numsLeft + 1, preorderEnd, rootIndexInInorder + 1, inorderEnd, inorderMap);

    return root;
}

TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
    if (preorder.empty() || inorder.empty() || preorder.size() != inorder.size()) return nullptr;

    unordered_map<int, int> inorderMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
        inorderMap[inorder[i]] = i;
    }

    return buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, 0, preorder.size() - 1, 0, inorder.size() - 1, inorderMap);
}

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> preorder = {3, 9, 20, 15, 7};
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};

    TreeNode* root = buildTree(preorder, inorder);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `buildTreeHelper` is a recursive function that constructs the binary tree recursively using the preorder and inorder traversals.
- `buildTree` is a wrapper function that initializes the map and calls the helper function.
- `printInorder` is a helper function to print the inorder traversal of the constructed tree for verification.

This code assumes that the input traversals are valid and that the tree does not contain duplicate values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Height of a Tree

Calculating the height of a tree in C++ typically involves a recursive traversal of the tree. The height of a tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for max function

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to calculate the height of a tree
int treeHeight(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return -1; // Height of an empty tree is -1
    } else {
        // Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = treeHeight(root->left);
        int rightHeight = treeHeight(root->right);
        
        // Height of the tree is 1 plus the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees
        return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    
    // Calculate and print the height of the tree
    cout << "Height of the tree: " << treeHeight(root) << endl;
    
    // Clean up memory (not necessary in this small example, but good practice)
    // This should be done using a proper tree deletion function in real scenarios
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code first defines a structure `TreeNode` to represent each node in the tree. Then, it defines a function `treeHeight` to calculate the height of the tree recursively. Finally, in the `main` function, a sample tree is created and its height is calculated and printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Height of Tree

To find the height of a tree, you typically use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Here's a simple approach using depth-first search in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    vector<Node*> children;
};

// Function to create a new node
Node* createNode(int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node;
    newNode->data = data;
    return newNode;
}

// Function to calculate the height of a tree
int heightOfTree(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return 0; // Base case: empty tree has height 0
    int maxHeight = 0;
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        maxHeight = max(maxHeight, heightOfTree(child));
    }
    return maxHeight + 1; // Adding 1 to account for the current node
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample tree
    Node* root = createNode(1);
    root->children.push_back(createNode(2));
    root->children.push_back(createNode(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(createNode(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(createNode(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(createNode(6));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(createNode(7));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(createNode(8));
    
    // Calculating and printing the height of the tree
    cout << "Height of the tree is: " << heightOfTree(root) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `Node` represents a node in the tree, containing data and a vector of child nodes.
- `createNode` is a utility function to create a new node.
- `heightOfTree` is a recursive function that calculates the height of the tree. It iterates through each child of the current node and recursively finds the height of each subtree. The height of the tree is the maximum height among its children plus one.
- In the `main` function, a sample tree is created, and the height of the tree is calculated and printed.

You can modify this code according to your requirements or the specific representation of your tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): How to create basic tree

Creating a basic tree data structure in C++ involves defining a node structure and implementing the necessary functions for insertion, deletion, traversal, and other operations. Here's a simple implementation of a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BinaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function for recursive insertion
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* root, int value) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            root = new TreeNode(value);
        } else if (value < root->data) {
            root->left = insertRecursive(root->left, value);
        } else {
            root->right = insertRecursive(root->right, value);
        }
        return root;
    }

public:
    BinaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to insert a value into the tree
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Function to perform an inorder traversal of the tree
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root != nullptr) {
            inorderTraversal(root->left);
            std::cout << root->data << " ";
            inorderTraversal(root->right);
        }
    }

    // Wrapper function for inorder traversal starting from the root
    void inorderTraversal() {
        inorderTraversal(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    BinaryTree tree;

    // Insert some values into the tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Perform inorder traversal
    std::cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    tree.inorderTraversal();
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `TreeNode` represents each node in the tree and contains an integer value, along with pointers to its left and right child nodes.
- `BinaryTree` is the binary tree class, which contains the root node pointer and functions for insertion and traversal.
- `insert` function inserts a new value into the tree.
- `inorderTraversal` function performs an inorder traversal of the tree, printing the values in sorted order.

You can expand upon this implementation by adding more functionality like preorder and postorder traversals, deletion, searching, and balancing algorithms if needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Huffman's Codes - Building Huffman Tree

Huffman's algorithm is a popular method for generating minimum-redundancy prefix codes. It's often used for data compression. To build a Huffman tree, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.
2. **Create Nodes**: Create a leaf node for each character and assign its frequency as the weight of the node.
3. **Build Priority Queue**: Put all the leaf nodes into a priority queue (min heap) based on their frequencies.
4. **Build Huffman Tree**: While there is more than one node in the queue, extract the two nodes with the lowest frequency, create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes' frequencies, and make the two nodes children of the new node. Insert the new node into the priority queue.
5. **Root of Huffman Tree**: The remaining node in the queue is the root of the Huffman tree.

Here's a simplified implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Node structure for Huffman Tree
struct Node {
    char data;
    unsigned frequency;
    Node *left, *right;

    Node(char data, unsigned frequency) : data(data), frequency(frequency), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Comparison function for priority queue
struct compare {
    bool operator()(Node* l, Node* r) {
        return (l->frequency > r->frequency);
    }
};

// Build Huffman Tree
Node* buildHuffmanTree(string data, int freq[], int size) {
    // Create leaf nodes for each character
    priority_queue<Node*, vector<Node*>, compare> minHeap;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (freq[i] > 0) {
            minHeap.push(new Node(data[i], freq[i]));
        }
    }

    // Build Huffman Tree
    while (minHeap.size() != 1) {
        Node *left = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();
        Node *right = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();

        Node *internalNode = new Node('$', left->frequency + right->frequency);
        internalNode->left = left;
        internalNode->right = right;

        minHeap.push(internalNode);
    }

    return minHeap.top();
}

// Utility function to print codes
void printCodes(Node* root, string code) {
    if (!root)
        return;

    if (root->data != '$')
        cout << root->data << ": " << code << endl;

    printCodes(root->left, code + "0");
    printCodes(root->right, code + "1");
}

int main() {
    string data = "abcdef";
    int freq[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45};
    int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    Node* root = buildHuffmanTree(data, freq, size);

    cout << "Huffman Codes are:\n";
    printCodes(root, "");

    return 0;
}
```

This code will build a Huffman tree for the given characters along with their frequencies and print the Huffman codes. Make sure to adjust it according to your specific requirements and error handling.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Huffman's Codes - Printing Huffman Codes

In Huffman coding, each character in a text is assigned a variable-length prefix code where the characters that have a higher frequency are assigned a shorter code. This reduces the overall size of the encoded text. Here's how you can print Huffman codes in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// A Huffman tree node
struct Node {
    char data;
    unsigned freq;
    Node *left, *right;

    Node(char data, unsigned freq) : data(data), freq(freq), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Comparison object to be used to order the heap
struct compare {
    bool operator()(Node* l, Node* r) {
        return (l->freq > r->freq);
    }
};

// Traverse the Huffman tree and store codes in a map
void encode(Node* root, string str, unordered_map<char, string>& huffmanCode) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Found a leaf node
    if (!root->left && !root->right) {
        huffmanCode[root->data] = str;
    }

    encode(root->left, str + "0", huffmanCode);
    encode(root->right, str + "1", huffmanCode);
}

// Build Huffman Tree and generate codes
unordered_map<char, string> buildHuffmanTree(string text) {
    // Count frequency of characters
    unordered_map<char, unsigned> freq;
    for (char ch : text) {
        freq[ch]++;
    }

    // Create a priority queue to store nodes of the Huffman tree
    priority_queue<Node*, vector<Node*>, compare> pq;

    // Create a leaf node for each character and add it to the priority queue
    for (auto pair : freq) {
        pq.push(new Node(pair.first, pair.second));
    }

    // Extract the two minimum frequency nodes from the priority queue and create a new internal node
    // with these two nodes as children and add the new node to the priority queue until there's only one node left
    while (pq.size() != 1) {
        Node *left = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        Node *right = pq.top(); pq.pop();

        Node *internalNode = new Node('$', left->freq + right->freq);
        internalNode->left = left;
        internalNode->right = right;

        pq.push(internalNode);
    }

    // Root of Huffman Tree
    Node* root = pq.top();

    // Traverse the Huffman tree and store codes in a map
    unordered_map<char, string> huffmanCode;
    encode(root, "", huffmanCode);

    // Clean up memory
    delete root;

    return huffmanCode;
}

// Print the Huffman codes
void printCodes(unordered_map<char, string>& huffmanCode) {
    cout << "Huffman Codes:\n";
    for (auto pair : huffmanCode) {
        cout << pair.first << " : " << pair.second << "\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    string text = "Huffman coding is a data compression algorithm.";

    unordered_map<char, string> huffmanCode = buildHuffmanTree(text);

    printCodes(huffmanCode);

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output the characters in the text along with their corresponding Huffman codes. You can modify the `main()` function to take input from the user or from a file if needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Expression Tree

Sure, here's a basic implementation of an expression tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the expression tree
struct Node {
    string data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(string val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to check if a character is an operator
bool isOperator(char c) {
    return (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/');
}

// Function to build the expression tree from postfix expression
Node* buildExpressionTree(string postfix) {
    stack<Node*> s;

    for (char c : postfix) {
        if (isspace(c)) // Skip whitespace
            continue;

        if (isOperator(c)) {
            Node* rightOperand = s.top();
            s.pop();
            Node* leftOperand = s.top();
            s.pop();

            Node* newNode = new Node(string(1, c));
            newNode->left = leftOperand;
            newNode->right = rightOperand;

            s.push(newNode);
        } else {
            Node* operand = new Node(string(1, c));
            s.push(operand);
        }
    }

    return s.top();
}

// Function to perform inorder traversal of the expression tree
void inorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->data << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example postfix expression: "ab+c*"
    string postfixExpression = "ab+c*";

    Node* root = buildExpressionTree(postfixExpression);

    // Inorder traversal to print infix expression
    inorderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code builds an expression tree from a postfix expression and then performs an inorder traversal to print the corresponding infix expression. You can modify the `main` function to input a different postfix expression and observe the corresponding infix expression.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Leaf Nodes in Trees

In C++, you can count the leaf nodes in a tree using various tree traversal techniques such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here's an example using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define the tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), children() {}
};

// Function to count leaf nodes using Depth First Search
int countLeafNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) // If the root is null, return 0
        return 0;
    if (root->children.empty()) // If the node has no children, it's a leaf node
        return 1;
    
    int leafCount = 0;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        leafCount += countLeafNodes(child); // Recursively count leaf nodes in each child
    }
    return leafCount;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(2));
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(6));

    // Counting the leaf nodes
    int leafCount = countLeafNodes(root);
    cout << "Number of leaf nodes: " << leafCount << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->children[0]->children[0];
    delete root->children[0]->children[1];
    delete root->children[1]->children[0];
    delete root->children[0];
    delete root->children[1];
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the tree. The `countLeafNodes` function takes the root of the tree as input and recursively counts the leaf nodes using Depth First Search. Finally, we create a sample tree in the `main` function, count the leaf nodes, and print the result.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Mango Trees

Mango trees are a delicious topic! When discussing algorithms and data structures related to mango trees, we can explore various aspects such as modeling the tree itself, managing the fruits (mangoes), and optimizing operations like harvesting or finding ripe mangoes efficiently.

Let's break it down into a few key areas:

1. **Modeling the Mango Tree**: You could represent a mango tree using data structures like trees or graphs. Each node could represent a part of the tree (trunk, branches, etc.), with child nodes representing smaller branches or fruit-bearing branches.

2. **Data Structures for Fruit Management**: Managing mangoes involves data structures to represent the fruits on the tree. This could be as simple as an array or a more complex structure like a priority queue to handle ripe mangoes first.

3. **Algorithms for Harvesting**: Harvesting ripe mangoes efficiently could involve algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the tree and pick ripe mangoes. Additionally, you might use techniques like pruning to optimize the harvesting process.

4. **Optimizing Growth and Yield**: To optimize mango tree growth and yield, algorithms can be used for tasks like determining the best time to prune branches, predicting fruit yield based on environmental factors, or even simulating different growth scenarios.

5. **Data Structures for Orchard Management**: If you're managing a whole orchard of mango trees, you might need data structures to represent the layout of the orchard, track tree health and fruit production, and optimize tasks like irrigation and fertilization.

In C++, you can implement these concepts using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and queues, along with algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, sorting, and optimization algorithms.

Here's a simple conceptual example of how you might represent a mango tree and perform a basic operation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct MangoTreeNode {
    vector<MangoTreeNode*> children;
    bool ripe;

    MangoTreeNode(bool ripe = false) : ripe(ripe) {}
};

class MangoTree {
private:
    MangoTreeNode* root;

    void harvestRipeMangoes(MangoTreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        if (node->ripe) {
            cout << "Harvesting ripe mango!" << endl;
            node->ripe = false; // Assuming we pluck the mango
        }

        for (MangoTreeNode* child : node->children) {
            harvestRipeMangoes(child);
        }
    }

public:
    MangoTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to harvest ripe mangoes
    void harvestRipeMangoes() {
        harvestRipeMangoes(root);
    }

    // Other functions for tree manipulation can be added here
};

int main() {
    // Creating a mango tree
    MangoTree mangoTree;

    // Adding nodes (branches) to the tree
    // Assuming some structure is built here...

    // Harvesting ripe mangoes
    mangoTree.harvestRipeMangoes();

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic example, but you can expand upon it to include more features and optimizations based on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max Subset Sum Tree

Creating a tree structure to find the maximum subset sum can be implemented using dynamic programming and recursion. Let's define a tree node structure and then write a C++ implementation for finding the maximum subset sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Tree Node Structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int v) : val(v) {}
};

// Function to find the maximum subset sum rooted at a particular node
int maxSubsetSum(TreeNode* root, unordered_map<TreeNode*, int>& dp) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    if (dp.find(root) != dp.end()) return dp[root]; // Memoization

    int takeNode = root->val;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        for (TreeNode* grandchild : child->children) {
            takeNode += maxSubsetSum(grandchild, dp);
        }
    }

    int skipNode = 0;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        skipNode += maxSubsetSum(child, dp);
    }

    // Store the result for memoization
    dp[root] = max(takeNode, skipNode);
    return dp[root];
}

// Function to create a tree from an adjacency list
TreeNode* createTree(vector<vector<int>>& adjacencyList, int rootIdx) {
    unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> nodes;
    for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.size(); ++i) {
        nodes[i] = new TreeNode(i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j : adjacencyList[i]) {
            nodes[i]->children.push_back(nodes[j]);
        }
    }
    return nodes[rootIdx];
}

int main() {
    // Example Usage
    vector<vector<int>> adjacencyList = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {}, {}, {}};
    TreeNode* root = createTree(adjacencyList, 0);

    unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> dp;
    cout << "Maximum subset sum: " << maxSubsetSum(root, dp) << endl;

    // Clean up
    for (auto& pair : dp) {
        delete pair.first;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a TreeNode structure to represent each node in the tree. The `maxSubsetSum` function recursively calculates the maximum subset sum rooted at each node, using dynamic programming to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, the `createTree` function is used to construct the tree from an adjacency list representation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max value in a Tree

Sure! Here's an example of how you can find the maximum value in a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int findMax(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        // If the tree is empty, return the smallest possible integer value
        // to indicate that there is no maximum value.
        return INT_MIN;
    }
    
    // Recursively find the maximum value in the left and right subtrees.
    int maxLeft = findMax(root->left);
    int maxRight = findMax(root->right);
    
    // Compare the maximum values in the left and right subtrees with the
    // value of the current node to find the overall maximum value.
    int maxNode = std::max(root->val, std::max(maxLeft, maxRight));
    
    return maxNode;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Find the maximum value in the tree
    int maxValue = findMax(root);
    std::cout << "The maximum value in the tree is: " << maxValue << std::endl;

    // Clean up allocated memory (not essential in this example, but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure `TreeNode` with an integer value and pointers to left and right children. The `findMax` function recursively traverses the binary tree to find the maximum value. The `main` function provides an example of how to use the `findMax` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Maximum White Subtree

The "Maximum White Subtree" problem is an interesting algorithmic problem often encountered in computer science. Here's an outline of how you might approach it in C++, assuming you have a tree data structure already defined.

The problem statement is usually something like this:

Given a binary tree where each node has a color (either white or black), find the maximum subtree such that all the nodes in that subtree are white.

Let's break down the solution into steps:

1. **Define the Tree Node Structure**: First, you need to define a structure for the nodes of the binary tree. Each node will contain data (perhaps a color) and pointers to its left and right children.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    bool isWhite; // Assuming true for white, false for black
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
};
```

1. **Define the Function to Calculate Maximum White Subtree**: You'll need a recursive function to traverse the tree and find the maximum white subtree.

```cpp
pair<int, TreeNode*> maxWhiteSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) {
        return {0, nullptr};
    }

    auto left = maxWhiteSubtree(root->left);
    auto right = maxWhiteSubtree(root->right);

    int count = left.first + right.first + (root->isWhite ? 1 : 0);

    if (count == (left.first + right.first + 1)) {
        return {count, root};
    } else {
        return {max(left.first, right.first), left.first > right.first ? left.second : right.second};
    }
}
```

1. **Invoke the Function and Print the Result**: You can invoke the function passing the root of the tree and then print out the result.

```cpp
void printMaxWhiteSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
    auto result = maxWhiteSubtree(root);
    cout << "Maximum white subtree size: " << result.first << endl;
    cout << "Root of maximum white subtree: " << (result.second ? "Exists" : "Doesn't exist") << endl;
}
```

1. **Example Usage**: You can create a sample tree and invoke the function to see the result.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode{true, 
                                   new TreeNode{false, nullptr, nullptr}, 
                                   new TreeNode{true, nullptr, nullptr}};

    // Print the result
    printMaxWhiteSubtree(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic outline of how you might approach the "Maximum White Subtree" problem in C++. Depending on the exact requirements or constraints of your problem, you might need to adjust this solution accordingly.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

To perform a postorder traversal of an N-ary tree, you can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Here's a C++ implementation of both methods:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

// Recursive approach
void postorderRecursive(Node* root, vector<int>& result) {
    if (!root) return;

    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        postorderRecursive(child, result);
    }

    result.push_back(root->val);
}

vector<int> postorderRecursive(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    postorderRecursive(root, result);
    return result;
}

// Iterative approach using a stack
vector<int> postorderIterative(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (!root) return result;

    stack<Node*> s;
    s.push(root);

    while (!s.empty()) {
        Node* node = s.top();
        s.pop();
        result.insert(result.begin(), node->val);

        for (Node* child : node->children) {
            if (child) {
                s.push(child);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(6));

    cout << "Recursive Postorder Traversal: ";
    vector<int> recursiveResult = postorderRecursive(root);
    for (int val : recursiveResult) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Iterative Postorder Traversal: ";
    vector<int> iterativeResult = postorderIterative(root);
    for (int val : iterativeResult) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` class representing each node in the N-ary tree. Then, it provides two functions for performing postorder traversal: `postorderRecursive` and `postorderIterative`. Finally, it demonstrates the usage of both functions in the `main` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): N-ary Tree Preorder Treversal

Sure, here's how you can perform a preorder traversal on an N-ary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node of an N-ary tree.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

void preorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Process the current node
    cout << root->val << " ";

    // Traverse all children recursively
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        preorderTraversal(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(4));

    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(6));

    preorderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Node` class representing a node in the N-ary tree. Each node has an integer value and a vector of child nodes.
- The `preorderTraversal` function performs a preorder traversal of the tree recursively. It first processes the current node, then recursively traverses each child node.
- In the `main` function, we create an example N-ary tree and call the `preorderTraversal` function to perform the traversal starting from the root node.

You can modify the `main` function to create different N-ary trees and test the preorder traversal algorithm.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): n-ary Trees

Certainly! N-ary trees are a type of tree data structure where each node can have a variable number of children, unlike binary trees where each node can have at most two children. Here's a basic overview of how you might implement an n-ary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for n-ary tree
template <typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value) {}
};

// N-ary tree class
template <typename T>
class NaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode<T>* root;

    // Helper function for recursive traversal
    void traverse(TreeNode<T>* node) {
        if (!node)
            return;
        cout << node->data << " ";
        for (TreeNode<T>* child : node->children) {
            traverse(child);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    NaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Destructor
    ~NaryTree() {
        // Implement destructor to free allocated memory
    }

    // Insertion method
    void insert(const T& value, TreeNode<T>* parent) {
        TreeNode<T>* newNode = new TreeNode<T>(value);
        if (!root) {
            root = newNode;
        } else {
            parent->children.push_back(newNode);
        }
    }

    // Traversal method
    void traverse() {
        if (root) {
            traverse(root);
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    NaryTree<int> tree;

    // Insertion example
    TreeNode<int>* parent = nullptr;
    tree.insert(1, parent);  // Insert root node
    tree.insert(2, tree.root);  // Insert child nodes
    tree.insert(3, tree.root);
    tree.insert(4, tree.root->children[0]);  // Insert grandchild nodes

    // Traversal example
    tree.traverse();  // Output: 1 2 4 3

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `TreeNode` is a template struct representing each node in the n-ary tree. It contains the node's data and a vector of pointers to its children.
- `NaryTree` is a template class representing the n-ary tree itself. It contains methods for insertion and traversal.
- The `insert` method inserts a new node with the given value as a child of the specified parent node.
- The `traverse` method performs a depth-first traversal of the tree, printing out the data of each node.

You can extend this implementation by adding more functionality such as deletion, searching, or balancing methods depending on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum

A path sum problem typically involves traversing through a tree data structure, such as a binary tree, and finding if there exists a path from the root to any leaf node whose sum equals a given target value. Here's a C++ implementation for a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    if (root == nullptr) return false;
    // If the current node is a leaf and its value is equal to the sum, then we've found the path
    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr && root->val == sum) return true;
    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees with updated sum
    return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    /*
         5
        / \
       4   8
      /   / \
     11  13  4
    /  \      \
   7    2      1
    */
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);
    
    int targetSum = 22;
    
    if (hasPathSum(root, targetSum)) {
        cout << "There exists a root-to-leaf path with the sum of " << targetSum << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No such path exists with the sum of " << targetSum << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree. The `hasPathSum` function recursively checks if there exists a path from the current node to a leaf node with the given sum.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum - Binary Trees

Certainly! In C++, you can implement the path sum problem for binary trees using recursion. The problem statement usually goes like this: Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    if (!root) return false; // Base case: empty tree

    // Subtract the current node's value from the sum
    sum -= root->val;

    // If it's a leaf node and the sum becomes 0, then we found a valid path
    if (!root->left && !root->right) {
        return sum == 0;
    }

    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    return hasPathSum(root->left, sum) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int sum = 22;
    if (hasPathSum(root, sum)) {
        std::cout << "There exists a root-to-leaf path with sum " << sum << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No root-to-leaf path with sum " << sum << " exists" << std::endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory (not necessary for the algorithm, but good practice)
    delete root->right->right->right;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left->left->right;
    delete root->left->left->left;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `hasPathSum` function recursively checks whether there's a path from the root to a leaf node with the given sum. The base case is when we reach a leaf node, and the current `sum` equals the leaf node's value. If we find such a path, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum - Trees

Sure, let's discuss the "Path Sum" problem for trees, a common question in algorithm interviews and a useful problem for practicing tree traversal techniques.

In the "Path Sum" problem, you're given a binary tree and a target sum. Your task is to determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Here's the general approach to solve this problem:

1. **Traverse the tree**: You can traverse the tree using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). In this case, DFS is more suitable because you need to explore all possible paths from the root to the leaves.

2. **Recursion**: Use a recursive function to traverse the tree. At each step, subtract the current node's value from the target sum and recursively check if the left or right subtree has a path sum equal to the remaining target sum.

3. **Base case**: The base case occurs when you reach a leaf node. Check if the remaining target sum equals the value of the leaf node. If it does, return true; otherwise, return false.

4. **Combine results**: If either the left or right subtree returns true, it means there's a path with the given sum in one of the subtrees. Return true in this case.

Here's a simple C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    // Base case: if the root is null, return false
    if (root == NULL)
        return false;

    // If the current node is a leaf and its value matches the sum, return true
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL && sum - root->val == 0)
        return true;

    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    // by subtracting the current node's value from the sum
    return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int targetSum = 22;
    if (hasPathSum(root, targetSum))
        cout << "Tree has a root-to-leaf path with sum " << targetSum << endl;
    else
        cout << "No such path found." << endl;

    // Don't forget to free the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we traverse the tree recursively, subtracting the value of each node from the target sum as we go. If we reach a leaf node and the remaining sum is 0, we return true indicating that a path with the given sum exists. Otherwise, we return false.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum II

Sure, I'd be happy to help with the Path Sum II problem. In this problem, you're typically given a binary tree and a target sum. The task is to find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given target.

Here's how you can approach this problem using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void findPaths(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    if (!root)
        return;

    // Add current node to the path
    path.push_back(root->val);

    // If this is a leaf node and the path sum equals targetSum, add the path to the result
    if (!root->left && !root->right && root->val == targetSum) {
        result.push_back(path);
    } else {
        // Recur for left and right subtrees
        findPaths(root->left, targetSum - root->val, path, result);
        findPaths(root->right, targetSum - root->val, path, result);
    }

    // Remove the current node from the path to backtrack
    path.pop_back();
}

vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    vector<int> path;

    findPaths(root, targetSum, path, result);

    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int targetSum = 22;
    vector<vector<int>> paths = pathSum(root, targetSum);

    // Displaying the result
    cout << "Root-to-leaf paths with sum " << targetSum << " are:\n";
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        cout << "[";
        for (int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) {
            cout << path[i];
            if (i != path.size() - 1)
                cout << ", ";
        }
        cout << "]\n";
    }

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right->right;
    delete root->right->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left->left->right;
    delete root->left->left->left;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the binary tree. It keeps track of the current path from the root to the current node and calculates the sum of the path. If the current node is a leaf and the sum equals the target, the path is added to the result. Otherwise, the algorithm recursively explores the left and right subtrees, subtracting the current node's value from the target sum. Finally, it backtracks by removing the current node from the path before returning to the parent node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Xor

"Path XOR" typically refers to a problem where you're given a tree and tasked with finding the XOR of values along a path from one node to another. Here's a simple explanation and C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;
    Node(int v) : val(v) {}
};

unordered_map<Node*, int> xorValues; // Stores XOR values for each node

// DFS to calculate XOR values for each node
void calculateXOR(Node* node, int parentXOR) {
    xorValues[node] = parentXOR ^ node->val; // XOR value for current node
    for (Node* child : node->children) {
        calculateXOR(child, xorValues[node]); // Recursively calculate for children
    }
}

// Function to find XOR of values on the path between two nodes
int pathXOR(Node* node1, Node* node2) {
    int xorResult = xorValues[node1] ^ xorValues[node2]; // XOR of values from root to LCA (Least Common Ancestor)
    return xorResult;
}

int main() {
    // Example tree creation
    Node* root = new Node(0);
    Node* child1 = new Node(1);
    Node* child2 = new Node(0);
    Node* child3 = new Node(1);
    Node* child4 = new Node(0);

    root->children = {child1, child2};
    child1->children = {child3, child4};

    calculateXOR(root, 0); // Calculate XOR values

    // Example queries
    Node* nodeA = root; // Example node A
    Node* nodeB = child1; // Example node B
    cout << "XOR of values on path between node A and node B: " << pathXOR(nodeA, nodeB) << endl;

    // Remember to free allocated memory
    delete root;
    delete child1;
    delete child2;
    delete child3;
    delete child4;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a tree structure and provides functions to calculate the XOR values along paths and find the XOR value between two nodes. The `calculateXOR` function performs a depth-first traversal to compute the XOR values for each node. Then, the `pathXOR` function calculates the XOR value along the path between two given nodes using their computed XOR values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Paths with Sums

To implement a solution for finding paths with sums in C++, you can use a tree data structure, like a binary tree, and traverse it while keeping track of the running sum. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int countPathsWithSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int currentSum, unordered_map<int, int>& prefixSumMap) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;

    // Update the current sum with the value of the current node
    currentSum += root->val;

    // Calculate the number of paths ending at the current node with the target sum
    int pathsWithSum = prefixSumMap[currentSum - targetSum];

    // If the current sum equals the target sum, increment the count
    if (currentSum == targetSum)
        pathsWithSum++;

    // Update the prefix sum map
    prefixSumMap[currentSum]++;

    // Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees
    pathsWithSum += countPathsWithSum(root->left, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumMap);
    pathsWithSum += countPathsWithSum(root->right, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumMap);

    // Restore the prefix sum map to its previous state before returning
    prefixSumMap[currentSum]--;

    return pathsWithSum;
}

int countPathsWithSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumMap;
    prefixSumMap[0] = 1; // Account for paths starting from the root
    return countPathsWithSum(root, targetSum, 0, prefixSumMap);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(-3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(-2);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int targetSum = 8;
    cout << "Number of paths with sum " << targetSum << ": " << countPathsWithSum(root, targetSum) << endl;

    // Remember to free the memory allocated for the tree nodes
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure and a function `countPathsWithSum` to count the number of paths in the tree that sum up to a given target sum. It uses a prefix sum map to efficiently track the running sum of paths encountered so far.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Performance Analysis of Red-Black Trees

Analyzing the performance of Red-Black Trees (RBTs) involves understanding their time complexity for various operations. Here's a rundown of the key operations and their time complexities in terms of Big O notation:

1. **Search (Lookup)**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Explanation: Similar to binary search trees, RBTs maintain their properties through balancing, which ensures that the tree remains relatively balanced. As a result, the search operation has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Insertion**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Explanation: Insertion in RBTs follows the same process as insertion in binary search trees, but with additional steps to maintain the properties of the RBT. This involves potentially restructuring the tree and recoloring nodes, which takes O(log n) time in the worst-case scenario.

3. **Deletion**:
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Explanation: Deletion in RBTs also requires restructuring and recoloring to maintain the properties of the RBT. Similar to insertion, this process takes O(log n) time in the worst case.

4. **Rotation**:
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Explanation: Rotations are constant-time operations, as they involve only a few pointer manipulations to restructure the tree.

5. **Fix-up Operations** (Color flips, rotations, etc.):
   - Time Complexity: O(1)
   - Explanation: Each fix-up operation (like recoloring and rotations) takes constant time, as they involve only a fixed number of pointer adjustments.

6. **Space Complexity**:
   - RBTs typically require additional space for storing color information (1 bit per node) compared to standard binary search trees. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

It's essential to note that these time complexities are based on the assumption of a well-implemented RBT with proper balancing and adherence to the RBT properties. In practical scenarios, the performance can vary depending on factors such as the distribution of data and the efficiency of the implementation. However, on average, RBTs provide efficient operations for search, insertion, and deletion, making them suitable for various applications where balanced trees are required.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Performance Analysis of Splay Trees

Analyzing the performance of data structures like Splay Trees involves understanding their key operations, their time complexity, and how they behave in various scenarios. Let's break it down:

### Splay Tree Overview

Splay Tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree where every operation on the tree causes a restructuring, called "splaying," that brings the most recently accessed item to the root. This makes recently accessed items quicker to access in future operations.

### Key Operations

1. **Insertion**: Insert a new element into the tree.
2. **Deletion**: Remove an element from the tree.
3. **Search**: Find an element in the tree.
4. **Splaying**: Reorganize the tree to bring the most recently accessed element to the root.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the operations in a splay tree varies depending on the tree's shape after each operation. In the average case, the amortized time complexity of splay tree operations is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. However, in the worst case, the time complexity can be O(n), such as when the tree becomes degenerate (essentially a linked list).

### Performance Analysis

1. **Amortized Performance**: Splay trees offer good amortized performance. Despite potential worst-case scenarios, the splay operation balances the tree during operations, leading to efficient average performance over many operations.

2. **Worst-case Scenarios**: Although splay trees provide amortized O(log n) performance, individual operations can occasionally degrade to O(n) in the worst-case scenario. This worst-case behavior typically occurs with sequences of operations that consistently access the tree in a specific pattern, leading to tree imbalance.

3. **Self-Adjusting Behavior**: Splay trees have the advantage of adaptively adjusting their structure based on access patterns. This means that frequently accessed elements move closer to the root, improving future access times for those elements.

4. **Cache Performance**: Splay trees may exhibit poorer cache performance compared to other balanced search trees like AVL or Red-Black trees because of their dynamic restructuring, which can lead to more unpredictable memory access patterns.

5. **Space Complexity**: Splay trees have similar space complexity to other binary search trees, requiring O(n) space for n elements.

### Conclusion

Splay trees are efficient for many practical scenarios due to their self-adjusting behavior and amortized O(log n) performance. However, their performance can degrade in specific worst-case scenarios. They are particularly useful when there is locality in the access patterns, as frequently accessed elements move closer to the root, improving overall performance. Nonetheless, in critical applications where worst-case performance is a concern, other balanced search trees may be preferred.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Practical (real-world) applications of trees

Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are used in various practical applications. Here are some real-world applications of trees:

1. **File System**: File systems in operating systems often use tree data structures to organize files and directories. Each directory can contain multiple files or subdirectories, forming a hierarchical structure.

2. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: BSTs are widely used in database systems and libraries for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They are also utilized in implementing associative arrays and symbol tables.

3. **Binary Heap**: Binary heaps, a specialized form of binary trees, are used in priority queues and scheduling algorithms. They efficiently support operations like insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum (or maximum) element.

4. **Syntax Tree**: In compilers and interpreters, syntax trees, also known as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), are constructed to represent the structure of source code. They are utilized in parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation phases.

5. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Tries are used in applications where efficient retrieval of a set of strings with a common prefix is required, such as autocomplete systems in search engines and text editors.

6. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**: BIT, also known as Fenwick tree, is used in algorithms that require efficient prefix sum computations, such as range queries and updating elements in an array.

7. **Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees**: These self-balancing binary search trees are commonly used in implementing associative containers like sets and maps. They ensure logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

8. **XML/HTML Parsing**: Trees are used to represent the hierarchical structure of XML and HTML documents. DOM (Document Object Model) parsers construct a tree-like structure to represent the elements and their relationships in these documents.

9. **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Trees are used to represent hierarchical data structures like organization charts, family trees, and menus in graphical user interfaces.

10. **Game Development**: Trees are used in various aspects of game development, such as scene graphs for representing game scenes, behavior trees for defining AI behaviors, and decision trees for game logic and dialogue systems.

These are just a few examples of how trees are applied in real-world scenarios. Trees provide efficient solutions for organizing, searching, and manipulating hierarchical data structures in diverse domains.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Pre-order Traversal Technique

Pre-order traversal is one of the fundamental techniques used in tree-based data structures. It's particularly common in binary trees and can be implemented recursively or iteratively. Here's how you can implement it in C++ using a recursive approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform pre-order traversal recursively
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Process the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Recursively traverse the left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Recursively traverse the right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform pre-order traversal
    std::cout << "Pre-order Traversal: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct to represent the nodes of the binary tree.
- The `preOrderTraversal` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and recursively traverses the tree in pre-order fashion.
- In the `main` function, we create a binary tree and call `preOrderTraversal` to perform the traversal.

This code will output:

```bash
Pre-order Traversal: 1 2 4 5 3 6 7
```

This output reflects the nodes visited in the order of pre-order traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): PrintTree

Certainly! Here's a simple implementation in C++ to print a binary tree using inorder traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    // Traverse the left subtree
    printInorder(root->left);
    // Print the current node's value
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    // Traverse the right subtree
    printInorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree structure and a function `printInorder` to print the tree using inorder traversal. You can modify the `TreeNode` structure and the `printInorder` function according to your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Representation of Trees

In C++, trees can be represented using various data structures. Here are a few common representations:

1. **Node-based Representation (using classes/structs):**
   You can define a `TreeNode` class/struct representing each node in the tree. Each node contains data and pointers to its children (usually left and right child in a binary tree).

    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int data;
        TreeNode* left;
        TreeNode* right;
        TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    };
    ```

2. **Array-based Representation:**
   For binary trees, you can use an array to represent the tree, where each node at index `i` has its children at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child).

    ```cpp
    vector<int> tree; // Assuming you have declared a vector to store the tree nodes
    ```

3. **Adjacency List Representation:**
   For general trees, you can use an adjacency list where each node stores a list of its children.

    ```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> tree; // Assuming you have declared a 2D vector to store the adjacency list
    ```

4. **Parent Pointer Representation:**
   Each node contains a pointer to its parent node, along with any other necessary information.

    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int data;
        TreeNode* parent;
        // Additional properties as needed
    };
    ```

5. **Specialized Representation:**
   Depending on the type of tree and its application, you may choose specialized representations. For example, for a binary search tree, you may have additional properties like balancing factors (for AVL or Red-Black trees).

Choose the representation based on the specific requirements and operations you need to perform on the tree. Each representation has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of memory usage, traversal efficiency, and ease of implementation for different operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Same Tree

In C++, determining if two binary trees are the same involves comparing their structures and values. You can do this recursively by traversing both trees simultaneously. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // If both trees are empty, they are the same
        if (!p && !q) return true;
        // If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are not the same
        if (!p || !q) return false;
        // If the values of the current nodes are not equal, they are not the same
        if (p->val != q->val) return false;
        // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
        return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* p = new TreeNode(1);
    p->left = new TreeNode(2);
    p->right = new TreeNode(3);

    TreeNode* q = new TreeNode(1);
    q->left = new TreeNode(2);
    q->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isSameTree(p, q)) {
        std::cout << "The trees are the same." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The trees are not the same." << std::endl;
    }

    // Free memory
    delete p->left;
    delete p->right;
    delete p;
    delete q->left;
    delete q->right;
    delete q;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct representing a node in the binary tree.
- The `isSameTree` function recursively checks if two trees are the same. It returns `true` if both trees are empty, or if their root nodes have the same value and their left and right subtrees are the same.
- In the `main` function, we create two example binary trees `p` and `q`, and then we use the `isSameTree` function to check if they are the same. Finally, we free the dynamically allocated memory.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Search Trees

Search trees are fundamental data structures used in computer science to organize and efficiently retrieve data. In C++, the most common search trees include binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. Let's briefly discuss each of them:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
   - The key property of a BST is that for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.
   - Searching, insertion, and deletion operations in BSTs have an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees, but can degrade to O(n) in the worst case if the tree becomes unbalanced.

2. **AVL Tree**:
   - An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node (known as the balance factor) is at most 1.
   - AVL trees maintain their balance through rotations (single and double rotations) during insertions and deletions.
   - The advantage of AVL trees over basic BSTs is that they guarantee O(log n) time complexity for all basic operations.

3. **Red-Black Tree**:
   - Red-black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
   - They ensure that the tree remains balanced by enforcing five properties:
     1. Every node is either red or black.
     2. The root is black.
     3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
     4. Red nodes cannot have red children.
     5. Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes must have the same number of black nodes.
   - Like AVL trees, red-black trees guarantee O(log n) time complexity for all basic operations.

4. **B-Tree**:
   - B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disk or other direct-access secondary storage devices.
   - They are characterized by a variable number of keys and children per node, typically denoted as B.
   - B-trees are widely used in databases and file systems because they minimize the number of disk accesses required to perform insertions, deletions, and searches.
   - Basic operations on B-trees have a time complexity of O(log n).

In C++, you can implement these search trees using classes and structs. Libraries like the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provide implementations for some of these data structures, such as `std::set` (implemented as a red-black tree) and `std::map` (implemented as a red-black tree or AVL tree depending on the implementation).

When implementing these data structures, consider not just the basic operations but also balancing mechanisms and edge cases to ensure optimal performance and correctness.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Segment Trees

Segment trees are a powerful data structure used mainly in the realm of competitive programming and algorithms where efficient querying and updating of segments of an array are required. They are particularly useful for range query problems, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or other associative operation over a range of elements in an array.

Here's a basic overview of how segment trees work:

1. **Construction**:
   - The segment tree is typically represented as a binary tree. Each node of the tree represents a segment or interval of the array.
   - The root of the tree represents the entire array, and each leaf node represents a single element of the array.
   - Each internal node of the tree represents the union of the intervals covered by its two children.

2. **Segment Tree Node**:
   - Each node of the segment tree contains information about the segment it represents. This information depends on the specific problem being solved. For example, in case of range sum queries, each node may store the sum of the elements in its corresponding segment.

3. **Querying**:
   - To answer a query over a given range [L, R], we traverse the segment tree starting from the root.
   - At each internal node, we check if its corresponding segment completely lies inside, completely outside, or partially overlaps with the query range.
   - If the segment lies completely outside the query range, we skip it.
   - If the segment lies completely inside the query range, we return the information stored at that node.
   - If the segment partially overlaps with the query range, we recursively search both of its children.

4. **Updating**:
   - To update the value of an element at a specific index, we start from the root and traverse down the tree until we reach the leaf node corresponding to the index.
   - We update the value at the leaf node and propagate the changes upwards to update the values of ancestor nodes as needed.

In C++, you can implement a segment tree using an array representation or a tree-based representation (using pointers or a vector). The array representation is more memory-efficient and faster, while the tree-based representation might be easier to understand and code.

Here's a simple example of a segment tree for range sum queries implemented in C++ using the array representation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> segment_tree;

void build_segment_tree(const vector<int>& arr, int node, int start, int end) {
    if (start == end) {
        segment_tree[node] = arr[start];
    } else {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        build_segment_tree(arr, 2 * node + 1, start, mid);
        build_segment_tree(arr, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end);
        segment_tree[node] = segment_tree[2 * node + 1] + segment_tree[2 * node + 2];
    }
}

int query_segment_tree(int node, int start, int end, int l, int r) {
    if (r < start || end < l) return 0; // Completely outside the query range
    if (l <= start && end <= r) return segment_tree[node]; // Completely inside the query range

    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    int sum_left = query_segment_tree(2 * node + 1, start, mid, l, r);
    int sum_right = query_segment_tree(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, l, r);
    return sum_left + sum_right;
}

void update_segment_tree(int node, int start, int end, int index, int new_value) {
    if (start == end) {
        segment_tree[node] = new_value;
    } else {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (index <= mid) {
            update_segment_tree(2 * node + 1, start, mid, index, new_value);
        } else {
            update_segment_tree(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, index, new_value);
        }
        segment_tree[node] = segment_tree[2 * node + 1] + segment_tree[2 * node + 2];
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
    int n = arr.size();

    // Build segment tree
    segment_tree.resize(4 * n);
    build_segment_tree(arr, 0, 0, n - 1);

    // Query example
    int sum = query_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 1, 3);
    cout << "Sum of elements in range [1, 3]: " << sum << endl;

    // Update example
    update_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 2, 10);
    sum = query_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 1, 3);
    cout << "Sum of elements in range [1, 3] after update: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation; there are more advanced techniques like lazy propagation to optimize updates, and other types of segment trees (such as segment trees for range minimum/maximum queries).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Shortest Tree Path

To find the shortest path in a tree, you can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's a C++ implementation of BFS to find the shortest path in a tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to add an edge between two nodes
void addEdge(TreeNode* u, TreeNode* v) {
    u->children.push_back(v);
    v->children.push_back(u); // For undirected tree
}

// Function to perform BFS to find the shortest path
int shortestPath(TreeNode* root, int target) {
    if (root == nullptr) return -1; // If the tree is empty

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int level = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (curr->val == target)
                return level; // Return the shortest path length
            for (TreeNode* child : curr->children)
                q.push(child);
        }
        level++; // Increment level for each level traversed
    }

    // If the target is not found in the tree
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    // Constructing a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    TreeNode* node2 = new TreeNode(2);
    TreeNode* node3 = new TreeNode(3);
    TreeNode* node4 = new TreeNode(4);
    TreeNode* node5 = new TreeNode(5);
    TreeNode* node6 = new TreeNode(6);

    addEdge(root, node2);
    addEdge(root, node3);
    addEdge(node2, node4);
    addEdge(node2, node5);
    addEdge(node3, node6);

    int target = 6; // Target node to find shortest path to
    int shortest = shortestPath(root, target);
    if (shortest != -1)
        cout << "Shortest path to " << target << " is " << shortest << endl;
    else
        cout << "Target node not found in the tree!" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing each node in the tree. The `addEdge` function connects two nodes by adding each other to their respective `children` vectors. The `shortestPath` function performs BFS to find the shortest path from the root to the target node. Finally, the `main` function constructs a sample tree, specifies a target node, and prints the shortest path length.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Spanning Tree

A spanning tree is a fundamental concept in graph theory, and it plays a crucial role in various algorithms, especially in network design, routing, and optimization. In the context of a graph, a spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree (a connected acyclic graph) and includes all the vertices of the original graph. Here's how you can implement a spanning tree in C++ using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Graph class representing the graph and its vertices
class Graph {
    int V; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adj; // Adjacency list

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V) {
        adj.resize(V);
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u); // For undirected graph
    }

    // Utility function to perform DFS recursively
    void DFSUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[v] = true;
        cout << v << " ";

        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u]) {
                DFSUtil(u, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to print the spanning tree using DFS
    void printSpanningTree(int startVertex) {
        vector<bool> visited(V, false);
        DFSUtil(startVertex, visited);
    }
};

int main() {
    int V = 6; // Number of vertices
    Graph g(V);

    // Add edges to the graph
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 4);
    g.addEdge(3, 5);

    cout << "Spanning tree using DFS starting from vertex 0: ";
    g.printSpanningTree(0);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Graph` class to represent the graph and its vertices using an adjacency list.
- The `addEdge` function is used to add edges to the graph.
- The `DFSUtil` function performs Depth-First Search recursively starting from a given vertex.
- The `printSpanningTree` function prints the spanning tree using DFS starting from a specified vertex.
- In the `main` function, we create a graph and add edges to it. Then, we print the spanning tree starting from vertex 0.

This is a simple example of finding a spanning tree using DFS. There are other algorithms like Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm that also find spanning trees, each with its own advantages and use cases.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Spanning Tree Algorithms

Spanning tree algorithms are fundamental in graph theory and are used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. In C++, two popular algorithms for finding MSTs are Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. Here's an overview of each:

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**:
   - Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
   - It begins with an empty spanning tree and adds edges to it one at a time, always choosing the edge with the smallest weight that does not produce a cycle.
   - This algorithm sorts all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights and then iterates through the sorted edges, adding each edge to the spanning tree if it doesn't create a cycle.
   - Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is typically used to efficiently detect and merge cycles.

   ```cpp
   // C++ implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm
   // Pseudocode:
   // 1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
   // 2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If not, include it in the spanning tree.
   // 3. Repeat step 2 until there are V-1 edges in the spanning tree, where V is the number of vertices.

   struct Edge {
       int src, dest, weight;
   };

   class Graph {
   public:
       vector<Edge> edges;
       // Function to find the MST using Kruskal's algorithm
       void KruskalMST();
   };

   // Driver code
   int main() {
       Graph graph;
       // Add edges to the graph
       graph.KruskalMST();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Prim's Algorithm**:
   - Prim's algorithm is another greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
   - It starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the spanning tree from there by always selecting the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the spanning tree to a vertex outside the tree.
   - Priority queues (typically implemented with heaps) are used to efficiently select the next edge to include in the MST.

   ```cpp
   // C++ implementation of Prim's Algorithm
   // Pseudocode:
   // 1. Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.
   // 2. Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE.
   // 3. While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices:
   //    a. Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.
   //    b. Include u to mstSet.
   //    c. Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as weight of u-v.

   // Function to find the MST using Prim's algorithm
   void Graph::PrimMST() {
       // Create a priority queue to store vertices that are not yet included in MST
       priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

       int src = 0; // Pick starting point
       vector<int> key(V, INF); // Key values used to pick minimum weight edge in cut
       vector<int> parent(V, -1); // Array to store constructed MST

       vector<bool> inMST(V, false); // To represent set of vertices not yet included in MST

       // Insert source vertex into priority queue and make its key 0
       pq.push({0, src});
       key[src] = 0;

       while (!pq.empty()) {
           int u = pq.top().second; // Extract minimum key vertex from priority queue
           pq.pop();

           inMST[u] = true; // Include vertex in MST

           // Update key value and parent index of adjacent vertices of the extracted vertex
           for (auto& edge : adj[u]) {
               int v = edge.first;
               int weight = edge.second;
               if (!inMST[v] && weight < key[v]) {
                   key[v] = weight;
                   pq.push({key[v], v});
                   parent[v] = u;
               }
           }
       }
       // Print edges of MST using parent array
       for (int i = 1; i < V; ++i)
           cout << parent[i] << " - " << i << endl;
   }
   ```

Both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms guarantee the generation of a minimum spanning tree. Kruskal's algorithm is often preferred when the graph is sparse, while Prim's algorithm can be more efficient for dense graphs.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Spanning Trees

Spanning trees are fundamental concepts in graph theory and are widely used in various algorithms and applications. In the context of computer science, particularly in C++, spanning trees are often employed in network design, clustering, and optimization problems. Here's a brief overview of spanning trees and how they relate to algorithms and data structures in C++:

#### Spanning Trees

A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph with the minimum possible number of edges required to connect them. It is a tree because it is acyclic and connected.

#### Algorithms

Several algorithms exist to find spanning trees of graphs. The most common ones include:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that can be used to find a spanning tree. By performing DFS from any starting vertex, we can construct a spanning tree that covers all the vertices reachable from that starting vertex.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Similar to DFS, BFS is another graph traversal algorithm that can be used to find a spanning tree. By performing BFS from any starting vertex, we can construct a spanning tree that covers all the vertices reachable from that starting vertex.

3. **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. It repeatedly adds the smallest edge that doesn't form a cycle until all vertices are included.

4. **Prim's Algorithm:** Prim's algorithm is another greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. It starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the spanning tree by adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

#### Data Structures

In C++, to implement algorithms for spanning trees, you may use various data structures such as:

1. **Adjacency List:** This is the most common representation of a graph where each vertex maintains a list of its adjacent vertices.

2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap):** Priority queues are often used in algorithms like Prim's and Dijkstra's. In Prim's algorithm, it helps to efficiently select the next edge to add to the spanning tree based on the weight of the edges.

3. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):** Union-Find data structure is used in Kruskal's algorithm to efficiently determine whether adding an edge creates a cycle in the spanning tree so that only non-cyclic edges are added.

4. **Custom Data Structures:** Depending on the specific requirements and optimizations, you may need to design custom data structures to improve the efficiency of your algorithms.

In C++, you can implement these algorithms and data structures using standard libraries like STL (Standard Template Library) or by implementing them from scratch.

Understanding spanning trees and the associated algorithms and data structures is crucial for solving various graph-related problems efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Subtree Checker

Sure, a subtree checker is a common problem in computer science and is often encountered in tree data structures. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Utility function to check if two trees are identical
bool areIdentical(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr && t == nullptr)
        return true;

    if (s == nullptr || t == nullptr)
        return false;

    return (s->val == t->val) &&
           areIdentical(s->left, t->left) &&
           areIdentical(s->right, t->right);
}

// Function to check if tree t is a subtree of tree s
bool isSubtree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr)
        return false;

    if (areIdentical(s, t))
        return true;

    return isSubtree(s->left, t) || isSubtree(s->right, t);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* s = new TreeNode(3);
    s->left = new TreeNode(4);
    s->right = new TreeNode(5);
    s->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    s->left->right = new TreeNode(2);

    TreeNode* t = new TreeNode(4);
    t->left = new TreeNode(1);
    t->right = new TreeNode(2);

    if (isSubtree(s, t))
        cout << "Tree t is a subtree of tree s." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Tree t is not a subtree of tree s." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in a binary tree.
- The `areIdentical` function checks whether two trees are identical by traversing them recursively.
- The `isSubtree` function checks whether tree `t` is a subtree of tree `s`. It does so by checking if `t` is identical to any subtree of `s` using the `areIdentical` function recursively.
- In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated by creating two binary trees `s` and `t`, and then checking whether `t` is a subtree of `s`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Subtree Problem

The subtree problem is a common problem in computer science and data structures. Given two trees, we're tasked with determining if one tree is a subtree of another.

Here's a basic approach to solve this problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Utility function to check if two trees are identical
bool areIdentical(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr && t == nullptr)
        return true;
    if (s == nullptr || t == nullptr)
        return false;
    return (s->val == t->val) && areIdentical(s->left, t->left) && areIdentical(s->right, t->right);
}

// Main function to check if 't' is a subtree of 's'
bool isSubtree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr)
        return false;
    if (areIdentical(s, t))
        return true;
    return isSubtree(s->left, t) || isSubtree(s->right, t);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* s = new TreeNode(3);
    s->left = new TreeNode(4);
    s->right = new TreeNode(5);
    s->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    s->left->right = new TreeNode(2);

    TreeNode* t = new TreeNode(4);
    t->left = new TreeNode(1);
    t->right = new TreeNode(2);

    if (isSubtree(s, t))
        std::cout << "Tree t is a subtree of tree s.\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Tree t is not a subtree of tree s.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree, containing an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `areIdentical` function checks if two trees are identical by recursively comparing their structures and values.
- The `isSubtree` function recursively checks if `t` is a subtree of `s` by first checking if they are identical, and then recursively checking in the left and right subtrees of `s`.
- In the `main` function, we create two trees `s` and `t`, and then check if `t` is a subtree of `s`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. There are more optimized approaches, like serializing the trees into strings and using KMP algorithm, or using hashmaps for faster subtree matching.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Sum of Nodes in Trees

Sure! Calculating the sum of nodes in a tree is a common operation in computer science and can be implemented using various algorithms. Here's a simple example of how you could implement this in C++ using a basic binary tree structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to calculate the sum of all nodes in the tree
int sumOfNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) // Base case: if the tree is empty
        return 0;
    
    // Perform a level order traversal using a queue
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int sum = 0;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // Add the value of the current node to the sum
        sum += current->val;
        
        // Add left and right children to the queue if they exist
        if (current->left)
            q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
    
    return sum;
}

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Calculate the sum of all nodes in the tree
    int totalSum = sumOfNodes(root);
    cout << "Sum of nodes in the tree: " << totalSum << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // (Not necessary for the example, but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a binary tree with integer values and calculates the sum of all nodes using a level-order traversal (breadth-first search) algorithm. The `sumOfNodes` function takes the root of the tree as input and returns the sum of all node values. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function by creating a sample binary tree and printing the sum of its nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symmetric Tree

Creating a symmetric tree in C++ involves ensuring that for every node in the tree, its left subtree is a mirror image of its right subtree. Here's a simple implementation of a symmetric tree check using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true; // An empty tree is symmetric

        return isMirror(root->left, root->right);
    }

private:
    bool isMirror(TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) {
        // If both subtrees are empty, they are mirrors
        if (!left && !right) return true;
        // If one subtree is empty but not the other, they are not mirrors
        if (!left || !right) return false;
        // If the values of the current nodes are not equal, they are not mirrors
        if (left->val != right->val) return false;

        // Recursively check if the subtrees are mirrors
        return isMirror(left->left, right->right) && isMirror(left->right, right->left);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isSymmetric(root))
        std::cout << "The tree is symmetric.\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The tree is not symmetric.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and a `Solution` class. The `isSymmetric` function checks if the tree is symmetric by calling the `isMirror` function which recursively compares corresponding nodes in the left and right subtrees. If the values match and their respective children subtrees are also mirrors, the tree is symmetric.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symmetric Tree - Binary Trees

Sure, let's dive into the Symmetric Tree problem in the context of binary trees using C++.

A binary tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree. To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to compare the left and right subtrees of the root node.

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true;
        return isSymmetricHelper(root->left, root->right);
    }

private:
    bool isSymmetricHelper(TreeNode* leftSubtree, TreeNode* rightSubtree) {
        // Base case: both subtrees are null, they are symmetric
        if (!leftSubtree && !rightSubtree) return true;
        
        // If one subtree is null but the other is not, they are not symmetric
        if (!leftSubtree || !rightSubtree) return false;
        
        // Compare values and recursively check subtrees for symmetry
        return (leftSubtree->val == rightSubtree->val) &&
               isSymmetricHelper(leftSubtree->left, rightSubtree->right) &&
               isSymmetricHelper(leftSubtree->right, rightSubtree->left);
    }
};

// Test the implementation
int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   2
    //   / \ / \
    //  3  4 4  3
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution sol;
    std::cout << "Is the tree symmetric? " << (sol.isSymmetric(root) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, `isSymmetric` is the main function to check if the tree is symmetric. It calls a helper function `isSymmetricHelper` which takes two subtrees and recursively checks if they are symmetric. If both subtrees are `null`, they are considered symmetric. Otherwise, it compares the values of the nodes and recursively checks the subtrees.

In the `main` function, I've provided an example of how to use this implementation by creating a binary tree and checking if it's symmetric.

Feel free to run and test the code! Let me know if you have any questions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symmetric Tree - Trees

Sure, let's delve into implementing a solution for checking if a binary tree is symmetric using C++.

Here's a basic approach:

1. We'll define a recursive function that takes two nodes as arguments. These two nodes represent the corresponding nodes in the left and right subtrees.
2. At each step, we'll compare if the values of these two nodes are equal. If they are not, the tree is not symmetric.
3. Then, we'll recursively check if the left subtree of the left node is symmetric with the right subtree of the right node, and if the right subtree of the left node is symmetric with the left subtree of the right node.
4. We'll continue this process until we reach the leaves of the tree.

Here's how you could implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* leftNode, TreeNode* rightNode) {
    if (leftNode == nullptr && rightNode == nullptr)
        return true;
    if (leftNode == nullptr || rightNode == nullptr)
        return false;

    return (leftNode->val == rightNode->val) &&
           isSymmetric(leftNode->left, rightNode->right) &&
           isSymmetric(leftNode->right, rightNode->left);
}

bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return true;
    return isSymmetric(root->left, root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(3);

    if (isSymmetric(root))
        cout << "The tree is symmetric." << endl;
    else
        cout << "The tree is not symmetric." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the `TreeNode` structure and implements the `isSymmetric` function. The `main` function demonstrates how to create a binary tree and check if it's symmetric.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Terminologies of Trees

Sure, let's explore some common terminologies used in trees, a fundamental data structure in computer science:

1. **Node**: Each element in a tree is called a node. A node can have a value associated with it and may also have references (links) to other nodes, called child nodes.

2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree. It's the starting point for traversing the tree. Every tree has exactly one root node.

3. **Parent**: A node that has child nodes. It's the immediate predecessor of its children.

4. **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root. Every node in a tree, except the root, is a child of some other node.

5. **Sibling**: Nodes that share the same parent are called siblings.

6. **Leaf**: Nodes that have no children. They are the terminal nodes of the tree.

7. **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child. It's any node in the tree that is not a leaf.

8. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root node is 0.

9. **Height**: The height of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

10. **Subtree**: A subtree is a tree formed by considering a node and all its descendants. Every node in a tree can be considered as the root of a subtree.

11. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.

12. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only values less than or equal to the node's value, and the right child contains only values greater than the node's value.

13. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

14. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

15. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

16. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

17. **Traversal**: The process of visiting all the nodes of a tree systematically. Common traversal algorithms include in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals.

Understanding these terminologies is essential for effectively working with trees and implementing algorithms and data structures based on them.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Terms related to trees

Certainly! Here are some terms related to trees in the context of algorithms and data structures:

1. **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It consists of a root node, which has zero or more child nodes, where each child node may have its own children.

2. **Node**: An individual element of a tree data structure, containing a value and references (pointers) to its children nodes.

3. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, from which all other nodes are descended. A tree has only one root.

4. **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes connected to it via edges.

5. **Child**: A node that has a parent node connected to it via an edge.

6. **Leaf**: A node in a tree that has no children, i.e., it is at the end of a branch.

7. **Internal node**: A node in a tree data structure that has at least one child.

8. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent in a tree.

9. **Depth**: The level of a node in a tree. The depth of the root node is 0, and the depth increases by 1 as you move away from the root towards the leaves.

10. **Height**: The maximum depth of any node in a tree. It is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

11. **Subtree**: A tree formed by selecting a node (and all of its descendants) from a larger tree.

12. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

13. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains a value less than the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value. This property facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

14. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the heights of the subtrees of any node differ by at most one. Examples include AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.

15. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

16. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children.

17. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

18. **Traversal**: The process of visiting and examining all nodes in a tree data structure. Common tree traversal algorithms include inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

19. **Inorder Traversal**: Traverses the tree in a left-root-right manner.

20. **Preorder Traversal**: Traverses the tree in a root-left-right manner.

21. **Postorder Traversal**: Traverses the tree in a left-right-root manner.

These are some fundamental terms related to trees in the context of algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): The Directed And Undirected Graph

Directed and undirected graphs are fundamental concepts in computer science and are often used in various applications such as network routing, social network analysis, and scheduling algorithms. Let's dive into each type:

#### Directed Graphs

A directed graph, also known as a digraph, consists of a set of vertices/nodes connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them. This means that the relationship between vertices is one-way. If there is an edge from vertex \( A \) to vertex \( B \), it doesn't necessarily imply the existence of an edge from \( B \) to \( A \).

In C++, you can represent a directed graph using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. Here's a brief overview of both representations:

1. **Adjacency List**: Each vertex maintains a list of vertices that it is connected to.

    ```cpp
    #include <vector>
    using namespace std;

    vector<vector<int>> adjList(n); // n is the number of vertices

    // Add edge from u to v
    adjList[u].push_back(v);
    ```

2. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D matrix where \( \text{matrix}[i][j] \) is true if there's a direct edge from \( i \) to \( j \).

    ```cpp
    const int MAXN = 100; // Maximum number of vertices
    bool adjMatrix[MAXN][MAXN] = {false}; // Initialize with no edges

    // Add edge from u to v
    adjMatrix[u][v] = true;
    ```

#### Undirected Graphs

An undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no direction. If there is an edge between vertices \( A \) and \( B \), it implies the existence of an edge between \( B \) and \( A \), and the relationship is bidirectional.

Similarly to directed graphs, you can represent undirected graphs using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> adjList(n); // n is the number of vertices

// Add edge between u and v
adjList[u].push_back(v);
adjList[v].push_back(u); // Since the graph is undirected
```

For adjacency matrix representation, it's symmetric:

```cpp
const int MAXN = 100; // Maximum number of vertices
bool adjMatrix[MAXN][MAXN] = {false}; // Initialize with no edges

// Add edge between u and v
adjMatrix[u][v] = true;
adjMatrix[v][u] = true; // Since the graph is undirected
```

Both directed and undirected graphs have their own set of algorithms and operations that can be performed on them, such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning tree algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's). Understanding these concepts and their implementations is crucial for solving graph-related problems efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree

Sure, I can provide an overview of trees in the context of algorithms and data structures in C++.

In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes. Trees are used for various purposes, including organizing hierarchical data and facilitating efficient searching, sorting, and retrieval operations.

In C++, trees can be implemented using classes and pointers. Here's a basic outline of a tree implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define a TreeNode structure
template <typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    TreeNode<T>* left;
    TreeNode<T>* right;

    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Define a BinaryTree class
template <typename T>
class BinaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode<T>* root;

public:
    BinaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Insertion function
    void insert(const T& value) {
        root = insertHelper(root, value);
    }

    // Helper function to insert a value into the tree
    TreeNode<T>* insertHelper(TreeNode<T>* node, const T& value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode<T>(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertHelper(node->left, value);
        } else {
            node->right = insertHelper(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Other tree operations like deletion, searching, traversal, etc. can be implemented here
};

int main() {
    BinaryTree<int> tree;

    // Insert some elements into the tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Perform tree operations as needed

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++. Binary search trees are a type of binary tree where the left child of a node contains only values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only values greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or if you'd like to know more about specific operations or variations of trees!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree / Binary Tree

Certainly! Trees and binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are used to store hierarchical data. Here's an overview of trees and binary trees in C++:

#### Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. The top node is called the root, and each node can have zero or more child nodes. Here's a simple implementation of a tree node in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

template<typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    std::vector<TreeNode*> children;
    
    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value) {}
};
```

This is a basic tree node structure that can hold any type of data. The `children` vector stores pointers to child nodes.

#### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a special type of tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here's a simple implementation of a binary tree node in C++:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct BinaryTreeNode {
    T data;
    BinaryTreeNode* left;
    BinaryTreeNode* right;
    
    BinaryTreeNode(const T& value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

This structure represents a node in a binary tree. Each node contains data and pointers to its left and right children.

#### Traversing a Binary Tree

Traversing a binary tree involves visiting each node exactly once. Common traversal algorithms include:

- **Inorder Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then current node, then right subtree.
- **Preorder Traversal**: Visit current node, then left subtree, then right subtree.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Visit left subtree, then right subtree, then current node.

Here's an example of inorder traversal of a binary tree:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void inorderTraversal(BinaryTreeNode<T>* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->data << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}
```

#### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value. This property enables efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Here's a basic implementation of a binary search tree in C++:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class BinarySearchTree {
private:
    BinaryTreeNode<T>* root;
    
public:
    BinarySearchTree() : root(nullptr) {}
    
    void insert(const T& value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }
    
    BinaryTreeNode<T>* insertRecursive(BinaryTreeNode<T>* node, const T& value) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return new BinaryTreeNode<T>(value);
        
        if (value < node->data)
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, value);
        else if (value > node->data)
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, value);
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

This code defines a basic binary search tree with an `insert` method.

These are just the basics. Trees and binary trees have many variations and extensions, such as balanced trees (AVL trees, red-black trees), binary heaps, and more. Understanding these structures and their algorithms is crucial for various applications in computer science and software development.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree 2 Linked List

In C++, converting a binary tree to a doubly linked list involves traversing the tree in a specific order and linking the nodes accordingly. Here's a general outline of how you can achieve this using the in-order traversal technique:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Definition for doubly-linked list node.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* prev;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* treeToLinkedList(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return nullptr;

        // Initialize the head of the linked list
        ListNode* head = nullptr;
        // Tail pointer to keep track of the last node of the linked list
        ListNode* tail = nullptr;
        
        convert(root, head, tail);

        return head;
    }

private:
    void convert(TreeNode* root, ListNode*& head, ListNode*& tail) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;
        
        // In-order traversal
        convert(root->left, head, tail);

        // Process current node
        ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(root->val);
        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            tail->next = newNode;
            newNode->prev = tail;
        }
        tail = newNode;

        convert(root->right, head, tail);
    }
};

// Utility function to print the linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        cout << head->val << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    Solution solution;
    ListNode* head = solution.treeToLinkedList(root);

    cout << "Linked List: ";
    printList(head);

    // Free allocated memory
    while (head != nullptr) {
        ListNode* temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree and converts it to a doubly linked list. The `convert()` function recursively traverses the tree, and for each node, it creates a new linked list node and links it to the previous node (if any) and updates the tail pointer to the newly created node. Finally, it returns the head of the resulting linked list.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree and Forest

Sure, let's dive into trees and forests in the context of algorithms and data structures using C++.

#### Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Here are some key concepts:

1. **Node**: Each element in a tree is called a node. Each node contains a value and may have a link to other nodes, called children nodes.
  
2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree is called the root node. It is the starting point for traversing the tree.

3. **Parent and Child**: Nodes in a tree are connected in parent-child relationships. A node may have zero or more children, and it has exactly one parent (except the root, which has no parent).

4. **Leaf**: A node with no children is called a leaf node. It is at the bottom of the tree hierarchy.

5. **Depth and Height**: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node. The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root node.

##### Implementation of a basic Tree in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

class Tree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    Tree() : root(nullptr) {}

    TreeNode* getRoot() {
        return root;
    }

    void insert(int val, TreeNode* parent) {
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);
        if (!root) {
            root = newNode;
            return;
        }
        parent->children.push_back(newNode);
    }
};

int main() {
    Tree tree;

    // Insertion
    TreeNode* root = tree.getRoot();
    tree.insert(1, root);  // root node
    tree.insert(2, root);  // child of root
    tree.insert(3, root);  // child of root
    tree.insert(4, root->children[0]);  // child of first child
    tree.insert(5, root->children[0]);  // child of first child

    return 0;
}
```

#### Forest

A forest is a collection of disjoint trees. In other words, it's a set of trees with no common roots. Each tree in a forest follows the same structure as described above.

##### Implementation of a Forest in C++

Creating a forest involves creating multiple trees and managing them as a collection.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

class Forest {
private:
    vector<TreeNode*> trees;

public:
    void addTree(TreeNode* root) {
        trees.push_back(root);
    }

    void insert(int val, TreeNode* parent, int treeIndex) {
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);
        parent->children.push_back(newNode);
        trees[treeIndex] = parent;
    }
};

int main() {
    Forest forest;

    // First Tree
    TreeNode* root1 = new TreeNode(1);
    forest.addTree(root1);
    forest.insert(2, root1, 0);
    forest.insert(3, root1, 0);

    // Second Tree
    TreeNode* root2 = new TreeNode(4);
    forest.addTree(root2);
    forest.insert(5, root2, 1);
    forest.insert(6, root2, 1);

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a forest with two trees. You can extend it to handle more trees as needed.

These are the basics of trees and forests in C++. They are fundamental data structures used in various algorithms, such as tree traversal, searching, and sorting.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree breadth first search

In C++, implementing breadth-first search (BFS) on a tree typically involves using a queue data structure to traverse the tree level by level. Here's how you can implement BFS on a tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void BFS(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Create a queue for BFS
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        // Get the front node in the queue
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Process the current node
        cout << current->val << " ";

        // Enqueue the left child
        if (current->left != nullptr) {
            q.push(current->left);
        }

        // Enqueue the right child
        if (current->right != nullptr) {
            q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform BFS on the tree
    cout << "Breadth-First Traversal: ";
    BFS(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `BFS` function performs breadth-first traversal on the tree using a queue. It starts from the root, enqueues each node's children (if they exist), and then dequeues the next node to process.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample binary tree and call the `BFS` function to traverse it.

This implementation prints the nodes of the tree in BFS order. You can modify it as needed to suit your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree breadth first search: Complexity analysis

The complexity analysis of breadth-first search (BFS) on a tree in terms of time and space can be broken down as follows:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - BFS traverses all the nodes in the tree level by level, visiting each node once.
   - In the worst case, every node and edge will be visited exactly once.
   - The time complexity of BFS on a tree is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.
   - In a tree, the number of edges is typically V - 1 (each node except the root has exactly one incoming edge).
   - So, the time complexity simplifies to O(V).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - BFS typically requires additional space for the queue data structure used for traversal.
   - At any point during the traversal, the queue may contain at most all the nodes of the current level.
   - The maximum number of nodes that can be in the queue at any time is the maximum number of nodes at any level.
   - In a tree, the maximum number of nodes at any level is the maximum number of nodes at any depth, which is typically the number of nodes in the last level.
   - Therefore, the space complexity of BFS on a tree is O(W), where W is the maximum number of nodes at any level (the width of the tree).

In summary:

- Time Complexity: O(V)
- Space Complexity: O(W)

In a balanced binary tree, the maximum width (W) is at most 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Hence, for a balanced binary tree, the space complexity of BFS would be O(2^(h-1)), which simplifies to O(2^h). However, in the case of a skewed tree, the width can be equal to the number of nodes in the last level, resulting in a space complexity of O(V) (as W ≤ V).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree depth first search

Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. In the context of trees, DFS starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Here's a simple implementation of DFS for a binary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

// Node structure for binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform depth-first search on a binary tree
void dfs(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    stack<TreeNode*> nodeStack;
    nodeStack.push(root);

    while (!nodeStack.empty()) {
        TreeNode* currNode = nodeStack.top();
        nodeStack.pop();
        cout << currNode->data << " ";

        // Push right child first so that it's processed after the left child (due to LIFO nature of stack)
        if (currNode->right) nodeStack.push(currNode->right);
        if (currNode->left) nodeStack.push(currNode->left);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Depth-First Search (DFS): ";
    dfs(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a depth-first search traversal of a binary tree using an iterative approach with a stack. It prints the elements of the tree in DFS order. Remember, DFS can be implemented recursively as well, but iterative implementations are often preferred for large trees or graphs to avoid stack overflow due to excessive recursion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree depth first search: Complexity analysis

Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. When applied to trees, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

The complexity analysis of DFS on a tree mainly depends on the structure of the tree and the implementation of DFS.

Let's break down the complexity analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - In a tree traversal, each node is visited exactly once.
   - If the tree has \( n \) nodes, the time complexity of DFS is \( O(n) \).
   - This is because each node is visited once, and the time taken to process each node is constant.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - In DFS, a stack (either explicit or implicit through recursive function calls) is used to keep track of nodes to be visited.
   - The maximum depth of the recursion stack corresponds to the height of the tree.
   - For a balanced binary tree, the height is \( O(\log n) \). Therefore, the space complexity of DFS is \( O(\log n) \) for a balanced binary tree.
   - However, for a skewed tree (where each node has only one child), the height of the tree becomes \( O(n) \), leading to a space complexity of \( O(n) \).

3. **Auxiliary Space Complexity**:
   - Apart from the recursion stack, DFS may also require additional space for other data structures used in the algorithm, such as a visited set or an explicit stack.
   - The space required for these data structures is also \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

In summary, the time complexity of DFS on a tree is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes, and the space complexity can vary depending on the structure of the tree: \( O(\log n) \) for balanced trees and \( O(n) \) for skewed trees. Additionally, the auxiliary space complexity is also \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter

Finding the diameter of a tree is a common problem in the realm of algorithms and data structures. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. Here's a C++ implementation of finding the diameter of a tree using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

// Tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to perform DFS and find the farthest node
pair<int, int> dfs(TreeNode* node) {
    if (!node) return make_pair(0, -1);
    
    int max_depth = 0;
    int farthest_node = node->val;

    for (TreeNode* child : node->children) {
        pair<int, int> result = dfs(child);
        if (result.first + 1 > max_depth) {
            max_depth = result.first + 1;
            farthest_node = result.second;
        }
    }

    return make_pair(max_depth, farthest_node);
}

// Function to find the diameter of the tree
int treeDiameter(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    // Finding the farthest node from the root
    pair<int, int> p1 = dfs(root);

    // Finding the farthest node from the farthest node
    pair<int, int> p2 = dfs(new TreeNode(p1.second));

    return p2.first;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(2));
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(6));

    cout << "Diameter of the tree: " << treeDiameter(root) << endl;

    // Remember to free the allocated memory
    // (Not necessary for this example, but for general case)
    return 0;
}
```

This code first defines a tree node structure and then implements DFS to find the farthest node from the root. Then, it finds the farthest node from that farthest node, which gives the diameter of the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter Concept

In the context of algorithms and data structures, the diameter of a tree is a fundamental concept that represents the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. It's a crucial metric in understanding the overall structure and efficiency of operations on trees.

Here's how you can understand and calculate the diameter of a tree:

1. **Understanding the Tree Diameter**:
   - In a tree, the diameter is the longest path between any two nodes. This path does not necessarily have to pass through the root node.
   - The diameter of a tree can be defined as the maximum of:
     - The diameter of the left subtree.
     - The diameter of the right subtree.
     - The longest path between two nodes that passes through the root.

2. **Calculating Tree Diameter**:
   - One way to calculate the diameter of a tree is by using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
   - Start DFS from any arbitrary node in the tree.
   - Find the farthest node from the starting node using DFS.
   - Then, from that farthest node, run another DFS to find the farthest node from it.
   - The distance between these two farthest nodes is the diameter of the tree.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   ```
   Function diameter(tree, node):
       If tree is empty or node is null:
           return 0
       max_left_subtree = diameter(tree.left, node)
       max_right_subtree = diameter(tree.right, node)
       diameter = max(max_left_subtree, max_right_subtree, height(tree.left) + height(tree.right) + 1)
       return diameter

   Function height(tree):
       If tree is empty:
           return 0
       return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))
   ```

4. **Implementation in C++**:
   ```cpp
   struct TreeNode {
       int val;
       TreeNode *left;
       TreeNode *right;
       TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
   };

   int height(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr)
           return 0;
       return 1 + max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
   }

   int diameter(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr)
           return 0;
       int leftHeight = height(root->left);
       int rightHeight = height(root->right);

       int leftDiameter = diameter(root->left);
       int rightDiameter = diameter(root->right);

       return max({leftDiameter, rightDiameter, leftHeight + rightHeight + 1});
   }
   ```

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - This is because for each node, we calculate the height of its left and right subtrees, leading to a potentially quadratic time complexity.
  
6. **Optimization**:
   - The above approach can be optimized using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid recalculating heights of subtrees.

Understanding the diameter of a tree is essential in various applications, including network routing algorithms, optimization problems, and computer graphics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter Optimised

Optimizing the calculation of the diameter of a tree, which is the longest path between any two nodes, typically involves performing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) from a chosen starting node. Here's an optimized C++ implementation using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a node in the tree
struct Node {
    int id;
    vector<pair<int, int>> adj; // Adjacency list representation of edges (connected node ID, edge weight)
};

// Function to perform DFS to find the farthest node and its distance
pair<int, int> dfs(const vector<Node>& tree, int node, int parent) {
    pair<int, int> farthest = {node, 0}; // Initialize the farthest node and its distance
    for (const auto& edge : tree[node].adj) {
        int child = edge.first;
        int weight = edge.second;
        if (child != parent) { // Avoid going back to parent
            auto childResult = dfs(tree, child, node);
            if (childResult.second + weight > farthest.second) {
                farthest = {childResult.first, childResult.second + weight};
            }
        }
    }
    return farthest;
}

// Function to find the diameter of the tree
int treeDiameter(const vector<Node>& tree) {
    // Start DFS from any node (here, we choose node 0)
    pair<int, int> farthestFromRoot = dfs(tree, 0, -1);
    // Perform DFS from the farthest node to find the actual diameter
    pair<int, int> farthestFromFarthest = dfs(tree, farthestFromRoot.first, -1);
    return farthestFromFarthest.second;
}

int main() {
    int n; // Number of nodes
    cin >> n;

    vector<Node> tree(n);

    // Input the edges and their weights
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w; // Edge from u to v with weight w
        tree[u].adj.push_back({v, w});
        tree[v].adj.push_back({u, w});
    }

    int diameter = treeDiameter(tree);
    cout << "Diameter of the tree: " << diameter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation avoids recomputation by only traversing the tree twice: once to find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting point, and then from that farthest node to another farthest node to determine the diameter. This ensures optimal time complexity for tree diameter computation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Distances

To calculate the distances between nodes in a tree, you can use a technique called dynamic programming. Here's a C++ implementation using Depth First Search (DFS) to calculate the distance between every pair of nodes in the tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100005; // Maximum number of nodes
vector<int> tree[MAXN]; // Adjacency list to represent the tree
int dist[MAXN][MAXN]; // Array to store distances between nodes

// Function to perform DFS to calculate distances
void dfs(int node, int parent, int root) {
    dist[root][node] = dist[root][parent] + 1; // Update distance from the root to the current node

    for (int child : tree[node]) {
        if (child != parent) {
            dfs(child, node, root); // Recur for child nodes
        }
    }
}

// Function to initialize distances for each node
void initDistances(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dist[i][i] = 0; // Distance from a node to itself is 0
        dfs(i, 0, i); // Calculate distances from node i to all other nodes
    }
}

int main() {
    int n; // Number of nodes
    cin >> n;

    // Input the tree edges
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v; // Edge between node u and node v
        cin >> u >> v;
        tree[u].push_back(v);
        tree[v].push_back(u); // Since the tree is undirected
    }

    // Initialize distances
    initDistances(n);

    // Output distances between all pairs of nodes
    cout << "Distances between all pairs of nodes:\n";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            cout << dist[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree.
- `dfs` function recursively calculates the distance between the current node and the root of the tree.
- `initDistances` initializes the `dist` array by calling `dfs` for each node as the root.
- The main function takes input for the tree edges, initializes distances, and then outputs the distances between all pairs of nodes.

This algorithm runs in O(N^2) time complexity, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Implementation

Sure, I can give you a basic implementation of a binary tree in C++. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to insert a new node into the binary tree
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return new TreeNode(val);
    }

    if (val < root->data) {
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    } else {
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to perform inorder traversal of the binary tree
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }

    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;

    // Insert some values into the tree
    root = insert(root, 5);
    insert(root, 3);
    insert(root, 7);
    insert(root, 2);
    insert(root, 4);
    insert(root, 6);
    insert(root, 8);

    // Print the inorder traversal of the tree
    cout << "Inorder traversal: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple binary tree structure with `TreeNode` containing data and pointers to left and right child nodes. The `insert` function inserts a new node into the tree while maintaining its binary search tree property. The `inorder` function performs an inorder traversal of the tree, printing the node values in sorted order. Finally, in the `main` function, we create a binary tree, insert some values, and then print the inorder traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Recursion

Tree recursion is a fundamental concept in algorithms and data structures, particularly in the context of recursive algorithms operating on hierarchical data structures like trees. In C++, you can implement tree recursion to traverse, search, modify, or perform other operations on trees efficiently.

Here's a basic example of tree recursion in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform a recursive traversal of a binary tree (In-order traversal)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left);    // Recursively traverse left subtree
    std::cout << root->val << " ";   // Process current node
    inorderTraversal(root->right);   // Recursively traverse right subtree
}

// Function to perform a recursive traversal of a binary tree (Pre-order traversal)
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    std::cout << root->val << " ";   // Process current node
    preorderTraversal(root->left);   // Recursively traverse left subtree
    preorderTraversal(root->right);  // Recursively traverse right subtree
}

// Function to perform a recursive traversal of a binary tree (Post-order traversal)
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    postorderTraversal(root->left);  // Recursively traverse left subtree
    postorderTraversal(root->right); // Recursively traverse right subtree
    std::cout << root->val << " ";   // Process current node
}

int main() {
    // Constructing a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Pre-order traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Deallocate memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `TreeNode` represents a node in a binary tree with an integer value and pointers to its left and right children. The `inorderTraversal`, `preorderTraversal`, and `postorderTraversal` functions perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the binary tree, respectively, using recursive calls.

These traversal methods are just a few examples of how you can apply tree recursion in algorithms. Depending on the problem you're solving, you might implement other recursive algorithms such as tree search, tree modification, or tree-based dynamic programming.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Terminology

Sure, I'd be happy to explain some tree terminology in the context of algorithms and data structures in C++!

1. **Node**: A fundamental unit of a tree, representing a single element. Each node contains a value and references to its child nodes (if any).

2. **Root**: The topmost node of a tree, from which all other nodes are descended. It is the only node in the tree that has no parent.

3. **Parent**: A node that has child nodes.

4. **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Leaf**: A node that has no children. It's at the "end" of the tree branches.

6. **Sibling**: Nodes that share the same parent.

7. **Depth**: The level of a node in a tree. The root node is at depth 0, its children are at depth 1, and so on.

8. **Height**: The maximum depth of the tree, i.e., the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

9. **Subtree**: A tree contained within another tree. It consists of a node in the main tree and all of its descendants.

10. **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

11. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than or equal to the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

12. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring that the tree remains relatively balanced and operations are efficient.

13. **Traversal**: The process of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specific order. Common traversal algorithms include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

14. **In-order Traversal**: A depth-first traversal algorithm that visits nodes in the order left, root, right. It is commonly used in binary search trees to visit nodes in sorted order.

15. **Pre-order Traversal**: A depth-first traversal algorithm that visits nodes in the order root, left, right.

16. **Post-order Traversal**: A depth-first traversal algorithm that visits nodes in the order left, right, root.

17. **Level-order Traversal**: A breadth-first traversal algorithm that visits nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving down through each level.

18. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

19. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

20. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

Understanding these terms is crucial for implementing and working with tree-based algorithms and data structures effectively in C++ or any other programming language.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Terms

Certainly! Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science with various terms associated with them. Here are some key terms related to trees in the context of algorithms and data structures, explained in C++:

1. **Node**: The basic building block of a tree that contains data and links to other nodes (child nodes).

    ```cpp
    template <typename T>
    struct TreeNode {
        T data;
        TreeNode<T>* left;
        TreeNode<T>* right;
        // Constructors, etc.
    };
    ```

2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree hierarchy. It has no parent.

3. **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.

4. **Child**: Nodes directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Leaf**: Nodes that have no children in the tree.

6. **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child.

7. **Subtree**: A tree within a tree. It consists of a node in the original tree and all of its descendants.

8. **Height**: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

9. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a particular node.

10. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

11. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

12. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

13. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

14. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

15. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

16. **Traversal**:
    - **Preorder**: Visit the root node, then recursively do a preorder traversal of the left subtree, followed by a preorder traversal of the right subtree.
    - **Inorder**: Recursively do an inorder traversal of the left subtree, visit the root node, then recursively do an inorder traversal of the right subtree. In BSTs, inorder traversal visits nodes in sorted order.
    - **Postorder**: Recursively do a postorder traversal of the left subtree, then recursively do a postorder traversal of the right subtree, followed by visiting the root node.

These are some of the fundamental terms related to trees in the context of algorithms and data structures using C++. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these terms!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree to Linked List

Converting a binary tree into a singly linked list is a common algorithmic problem in computer science. Here's a simple approach to do this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Definition for a singly-linked list node.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        
        // Save the right subtree
        TreeNode* rightSubtree = root->right;
        
        // If the left subtree is not empty, move it to the right
        if (root->left) {
            root->right = root->left;
            root->left = nullptr;
            
            // Find the rightmost node of the new right subtree
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            while (temp->right) {
                temp = temp->right;
            }
            
            // Attach the saved right subtree to the rightmost node
            temp->right = rightSubtree;
        }
        
        // Flatten the right subtree
        flatten(root->right);
    }
    
    // Helper function to print the linked list
    void printList(ListNode* head) {
        while (head) {
            cout << head->val << " -> ";
            head = head->next;
        }
        cout << "null" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);
    
    // Flatten the binary tree
    solution.flatten(root);
    
    // Print the linked list
    cout << "Linked list after flattening the binary tree: " << endl;
    solution.printList(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a binary tree node `TreeNode` and a singly linked list node `ListNode`.
- The `flatten` function converts the binary tree into a linked list in place using a recursive approach.
- We traverse the tree in a preorder manner and for each node, we:
  - Save the right subtree.
  - If the left subtree exists, we move it to the right side and attach the saved right subtree to the rightmost node of the new right subtree.
  - Recursively flatten the right subtree.
- Finally, we print the linked list to verify the result.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is a fundamental operation in computer science used to visit all the nodes of a tree. There are several methods to traverse a tree, each with its own use case. In C++, you can implement these traversals using recursion or iterative approaches.

Here are the three common types of tree traversals:

1. **Inorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, root, and right subtree.

2. **Preorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of root, left subtree, and right subtree.

3. **Postorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, right subtree, and root.

Here's a basic implementation of these tree traversals using a binary tree structure in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in a binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Recursive function for inorder traversal
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Recursive function for preorder traversal
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        preorderTraversal(root->left);
        preorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Recursive function for postorder traversal
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        postorderTraversal(root->left);
        postorderTraversal(root->right);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the three types of tree traversals using a simple binary tree structure. You can modify it according to your requirements or extend it to work with other types of trees as well.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Traversal Techniques of a Binary Tree

In C++, there are several ways to traverse a binary tree, each with its own advantages and use cases. Here are the three main traversal techniques: **in-order**, **pre-order**, and **post-order** traversal.

#### In-order Traversal

In in-order traversal, the left subtree is recursively visited first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. In a binary search tree (BST), this traversal would visit the nodes in ascending order.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

void inOrderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->data << " ";
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}
```

#### Pre-order Traversal

In pre-order traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.

```cpp
void preOrderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    cout << root->data << " ";
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}
```

#### Post-order Traversal

In post-order traversal, the left and right subtrees are recursively visited before visiting the root node.

```cpp
void postOrderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    postOrderTraversal(root->left);
    postOrderTraversal(root->right);
    cout << root->data << " ";
}
```

#### Usage Example

To use these traversal functions, you can create a binary tree and call the respective traversal function with the root node.

```cpp
int main() {
    Node* root = new Node{1};
    root->left = new Node{2};
    root->right = new Node{3};
    root->left->left = new Node{4};
    root->left->right = new Node{5};

    cout << "In-order traversal: ";
    inOrderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Pre-order traversal: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    postOrderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This will output:

```bash
In-order traversal: 4 2 5 1 3 
Pre-order traversal: 1 2 4 5 3 
Post-order traversal: 4 5 2 3 1 
```

These traversal techniques are fundamental in many tree-related algorithms and are commonly used in problems involving binary trees.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Traversals

Tree traversals are fundamental operations in dealing with tree data structures. In C++, you can implement tree traversals using various techniques such as recursion or iterative methods. Here's how you can perform the three main types of tree traversals: preorder, inorder, and postorder.

Let's assume you have a basic binary tree node structure defined like this:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

Now, let's implement the three types of traversals:

1. **Preorder Traversal**: Visit the current node, then traverse the left subtree, and finally traverse the right subtree.

```cpp
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    cout << root->val << " "; // Visit current node
    preorderTraversal(root->left); // Traverse left subtree
    preorderTraversal(root->right); // Traverse right subtree
}
```

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, visit the current node, and then traverse the right subtree.

```cpp
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorderTraversal(root->left); // Traverse left subtree
    cout << root->val << " "; // Visit current node
    inorderTraversal(root->right); // Traverse right subtree
}
```

1. **Postorder Traversal**: Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and then visit the current node.

```cpp
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    postorderTraversal(root->left); // Traverse left subtree
    postorderTraversal(root->right); // Traverse right subtree
    cout << root->val << " "; // Visit current node
}
```

These are the basic recursive implementations of tree traversals in C++. Depending on your needs, you might also consider implementing iterative versions of these traversals using stacks or queues to achieve the same results.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree with Maximum Cost

To implement a tree with maximum cost in C++, you would typically use a data structure like a binary tree or an n-ary tree. The "maximum cost" could refer to various things depending on your specific problem, such as maximum sum of values along the path, maximum product, or any other criterion.

Let's assume you want to build a binary tree where each node contains a cost, and you want to find the path from the root to a leaf node that maximizes the sum of costs along that path. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root, int& maxSum) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;

    // Calculate the maximum path sum for the left and right subtrees
    int leftMax = max(0, maxPathSum(root->left, maxSum));
    int rightMax = max(0, maxPathSum(root->right, maxSum));

    // Update the maximum sum found so far
    maxSum = max(maxSum, leftMax + rightMax + root->val);

    // Return the maximum path sum from the current node
    return max(leftMax, rightMax) + root->val;
}

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN; // Initialize with the smallest possible value
    maxPathSum(root, maxSum);
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(-25);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(4);

    cout << "Maximum path sum is " << maxPathSum(root) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree.
- The `maxPathSum` function recursively calculates the maximum path sum starting from each node, keeping track of the maximum sum found so far.
- The `maxPathSum` function is overloaded to provide a convenient interface for the user.
- In the `main` function, an example binary tree is created, and the maximum path sum is printed.

You can modify this code according to your specific problem requirements, such as changing the criterion for determining the maximum cost or using a different type of tree structure.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Count Leaf Nodes

To count the number of leaf nodes in a tree using C++, you typically need a tree data structure. Here's a simple implementation using a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree
int countLeafNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) // Base case: empty tree
        return 0;
    else if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) // Base case: leaf node
        return 1;
    else
        return countLeafNodes(root->left) + countLeafNodes(root->right); // Recursive case: count leaf nodes in left and right subtrees
}

// Function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);
    return node;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(1);
    root->left = newNode(2);
    root->right = newNode(3);
    root->left->left = newNode(4);
    root->left->right = newNode(5);
    root->right->left = newNode(6);
    root->right->right = newNode(7);

    // Counting leaf nodes
    int leafCount = countLeafNodes(root);
    cout << "Number of leaf nodes: " << leafCount << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `countLeafNodes` function recursively traverses the binary tree and counts the leaf nodes.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample binary tree and then call `countLeafNodes` to get the count of leaf nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Count Nodes

To count the nodes in a tree using C++, you can implement a simple recursive algorithm. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to count nodes in a binary tree
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) // Base case: empty tree
        return 0;
    // Recursive case: count nodes in left and right subtrees and add 1 for the current node
    return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \ /
    //  4  5 6
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);

    // Count nodes
    int nodeCount = countNodes(root);
    std::cout << "Number of nodes in the tree: " << nodeCount << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `countNodes` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and recursively counts the nodes by adding 1 for the current node and recursively counting the nodes in its left and right subtrees. The base case is when the root is nullptr, in which case the count is 0.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Delete Tree

Deleting a tree in C++ involves freeing the memory allocated for each node in the tree. This typically requires a recursive approach to traverse the tree and delete each node. Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void deleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Delete left subtree
    deleteTree(root->left);
    // Delete right subtree
    deleteTree(root->right);

    // Delete current node
    delete root;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    // Deleting the tree
    deleteTree(root);

    // After deletion, root should be nullptr
    if (root == nullptr)
        std::cout << "Tree deleted successfully" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Error: Tree deletion failed" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a `TreeNode` structure representing a node in the binary tree.
2. We define the `deleteTree` function which recursively deletes the tree. It deletes the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
3. In the `main` function, we create a sample tree and then delete it using the `deleteTree` function.
4. We check if the root is `nullptr` after deletion to ensure the tree was deleted successfully.

Remember to use this code carefully, especially in larger programs, to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper memory management.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Height Balanced Binary Tree

Sure, a Height Balanced Binary Tree is a binary tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. Here's a simple implementation of a Height Balanced Binary Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }
    
    int checkHeight(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;
        
        int leftHeight = checkHeight(root->left);
        if (leftHeight == -1)
            return -1;
        
        int rightHeight = checkHeight(root->right);
        if (rightHeight == -1)
            return -1;
        
        int heightDiff = abs(leftHeight - rightHeight);
        if (heightDiff > 1)
            return -1;
        else
            return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` struct defines the structure of a binary tree node.
- The `checkHeight` function is a helper function that recursively computes the height of each subtree while checking for balance. It returns `-1` if the tree is not height balanced, otherwise, it returns the height of the tree.
- The `isBalanced` function checks if the tree is height balanced by calling `checkHeight` and verifying if it returns a valid height or `-1`. If it returns `-1`, the tree is not height balanced, otherwise, it is.

You can use this `Solution` class to create a height-balanced binary tree and check if it's balanced.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Inorder Traversal

In C++, inorder traversal of a binary tree can be implemented using recursion. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    
    // Traverse the left subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    
    // Visit the current node
    cout << root->val << " ";
    
    // Traverse the right subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    cout << "Inorder traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and implements the `inorderTraversal` function to perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree. In the `main` function, a sample binary tree is created and its inorder traversal is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Level Order

Sure, I can provide you with an example implementation of the level order traversal of a binary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    
    // Create a queue to store nodes at each level
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        // Get the current size of the queue
        int size = q.size();
        
        // Traverse all nodes at the current level
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            TreeNode* current = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            // Process the current node
            cout << current->val << " ";
            
            // Enqueue the left child, if exists
            if (current->left != NULL)
                q.push(current->left);
            
            // Enqueue the right child, if exists
            if (current->right != NULL)
                q.push(current->right);
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next level
    }
}

// Sample usage
int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Print level order traversal
    levelOrder(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the level order traversal of a binary tree using a queue data structure. The `levelOrder` function takes the root of the binary tree as input and prints the nodes in level order, i.e., starting from the root, then printing all nodes at level 1, then all nodes at level 2, and so on.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Level Order Traversal

In C++, performing a level order traversal on a tree typically involves using a queue to traverse the tree level by level. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();

        // Traverse nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            cout << node->val << " ";

            // Enqueue left and right children if they exist
            if (node->left != NULL)
                q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right != NULL)
                q.push(node->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \ / \
    //  4  5 6  7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Level Order Traversal: ";
    levelOrder(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a level order traversal of a binary tree. It uses a queue to process each level of the tree. The `levelOrder` function takes the root of the tree as input and prints the nodes level by level.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Post Order Traversal

In C++, you can implement a post-order traversal of a tree using recursion. Here's a basic example of how you can implement post-order traversal for a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void postOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    // Traverse left subtree
    postOrderTraversal(root->left);
    // Traverse right subtree
    postOrderTraversal(root->right);
    // Visit the root
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    postOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree.
- The `postOrderTraversal` function recursively traverses the tree in post-order, visiting the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
- In the `main` function, we create an example binary tree and call the `postOrderTraversal` function to perform a post-order traversal.

Remember to deallocate memory properly to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: PostOrder Traversal

In C++, a post-order traversal of a tree involves visiting the nodes in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root node. Here's how you can implement post-order traversal for a binary tree using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    postorderTraversal(root->left);    // Visit left subtree
    postorderTraversal(root->right);   // Visit right subtree
    std::cout << root->val << " ";     // Visit root node
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    // Constructing a simple binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Postorder traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Remember to deallocate memory to prevent memory leaks
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a simple binary tree structure (`TreeNode`) and a function `postorderTraversal` to traverse the tree in post-order. In the `main()` function, an example tree is created, and its post-order traversal is printed. Finally, memory allocated for the tree nodes is deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Pre Order Traversal

In C++, a pre-order traversal of a tree means visiting the root node first, then recursively visiting the left subtree, followed by visiting the right subtree. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree node and the pre-order traversal algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform pre-order traversal
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Visit the root node
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    
    // Traverse left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);
    
    // Traverse right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    
    std::cout << "Pre-order traversal of the binary tree: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Clean up allocated memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a simple binary tree node structure and the pre-order traversal algorithm applied to it. The `preOrderTraversal` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and prints the nodes in pre-order. Finally, remember to deallocate the memory allocated for the tree nodes to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: PreOrder Traversal

Sure, I can help you with that! Preorder traversal is a type of tree traversal algorithm where each node is processed before (pre) its child nodes. In C++, you can implement pre-order traversal using recursion. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure for the tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform pre-order traversal
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Process the current node
    cout << root->data << " ";

    // Traverse left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Traverse right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform pre-order traversal
    cout << "Preorder traversal: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up memory (not necessary for algorithm demonstration)
    // Implement cleanup as needed for your application
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a structure `TreeNode` to represent each node of the binary tree.
- The `preOrderTraversal` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and recursively traverses the tree in pre-order fashion, printing the data of each node.
- In the `main` function, we create a binary tree and call the `preOrderTraversal` function with the root node to perform pre-order traversal.

This code will output the pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Print All Nodes at Level K

To print all nodes at level K in a binary tree, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to print all nodes at level K
void printNodesAtLevelK(TreeNode* root, int k) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    
    if (k == 0) {
        cout << root->val << " ";
    }
    else {
        printNodesAtLevelK(root->left, k - 1);
        printNodesAtLevelK(root->right, k - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    int k = 2; // Level K

    cout << "Nodes at level " << k << ": ";
    printNodesAtLevelK(root, k);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a TreeNode structure representing each node of the binary tree. The `printNodesAtLevelK` function recursively traverses the tree, decrementing the level `k` until it reaches 0, at which point it prints the value of the current node. The main function creates an example binary tree and calls `printNodesAtLevelK` to print all nodes at level `k`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Print Level Order

Printing a binary tree in level order (also known as breadth-first traversal) involves traversing the tree level by level, from top to bottom and left to right, and printing the nodes at each level. This can be achieved using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes at each level. Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void printLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();

        // Print nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            cout << node->val << " ";

            // Enqueue left child
            if (node->left != nullptr) {
                q.push(node->left);
            }

            // Enqueue right child
            if (node->right != nullptr) {
                q.push(node->right);
            }
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next level
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Level order traversal of binary tree:\n";
    printLevelOrder(root);

    // Clean up memory
    // You should implement a proper cleanup function to avoid memory leaks
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct representing each node of the binary tree and a `printLevelOrder` function that performs the level-order traversal using a queue. Finally, in the `main` function, an example binary tree is created and printed using the `printLevelOrder` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Take Input Level Wise

To take input for a tree level-wise in C++, you can use a queue to store the nodes level by level. Here's a basic approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* takeInputLevelWise() {
    cout << "Enter root value: ";
    int rootData;
    cin >> rootData;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootData);

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        cout << "Enter left child of " << current->data << " (-1 if none): ";
        int leftData;
        cin >> leftData;
        if (leftData != -1) {
            current->left = new TreeNode(leftData);
            q.push(current->left);
        }

        cout << "Enter right child of " << current->data << " (-1 if none): ";
        int rightData;
        cin >> rightData;
        if (rightData != -1) {
            current->right = new TreeNode(rightData);
            q.push(current->right);
        }
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to print tree (BFS traversal)
void printLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        cout << current->data << " ";

        if (current->left != nullptr) q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right != nullptr) q.push(current->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = takeInputLevelWise();
    cout << "Tree (BFS order): ";
    printLevelOrder(root);
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code allows you to input the tree level-wise. You start with the root node, then for each node, you input its left and right children. `-1` is used to denote that a child doesn't exist. The BFS traversal function `printLevelOrder` is included to verify the input.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Take Input Recursive

Sure, taking input for a tree recursively in C++ involves traversing the tree in a recursive manner and adding nodes as you encounter them. Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to recursively take input for a binary tree
TreeNode* takeInput() {
    int val;
    cout << "Enter node value (or -1 for NULL): ";
    cin >> val;
    if (val == -1) {
        return nullptr; // NULL node
    }

    // Create a new node
    TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);

    // Recursively take input for left and right subtrees
    cout << "Enter left child of " << val << ":\n";
    newNode->left = takeInput();
    cout << "Enter right child of " << val << ":\n";
    newNode->right = takeInput();

    return newNode;
}

// Function to print the tree inorder (for validation)
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = takeInput();
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the tree: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code prompts the user to input values for each node of the tree, including `-1` to denote a NULL child. It then constructs the tree recursively based on the user input and finally prints the inorder traversal of the constructed tree for validation.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or assistance!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): TreeNode Class

Sure, here's a simple implementation of a `TreeNode` class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class TreeNode {
private:
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

public:
    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value) {}

    // Destructor to deallocate memory
    ~TreeNode() {
        for (TreeNode* child : children) {
            delete child;
        }
    }

    // Getter for data
    T getData() const {
        return data;
    }

    // Setter for data
    void setData(const T& value) {
        data = value;
    }

    // Add child node
    void addChild(TreeNode* child) {
        children.push_back(child);
    }

    // Get children
    const vector<TreeNode*>& getChildren() const {
        return children;
    }

    // Check if node has children
    bool hasChildren() const {
        return !children.empty();
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` class is a generic class, meaning it can hold any type of data.
- It has a constructor that takes the value of the node and initializes the data member.
- The `children` vector stores pointers to child nodes.
- There are methods to get and set data, add child nodes, get children, and check if the node has children.
- The destructor deallocates memory by recursively deleting all child nodes.

You can use this `TreeNode` class to build various tree structures and perform operations on them.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees

Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are widely used in various applications, including hierarchical data representation, searching, and sorting. In C++, you can implement trees using classes and structures. Here's a brief overview of some common tree types and their implementations:

1. **Binary Tree**:
   - Each node has at most two children: left and right.
   - In C++, you can implement a binary tree using a class that has pointers to the left and right child nodes.
   - Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder) are commonly implemented for binary trees.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - A binary tree with the property that for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
   - In C++, you need to ensure that when inserting a node into a BST, it's inserted in the correct position based on its value.
   - Operations like search, insertion, and deletion are commonly implemented for BSTs.

3. **AVL Tree**:
   - A self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.
   - In C++, you can implement AVL trees using rotations to maintain balance during insertion and deletion operations.
   - Operations are similar to those of BSTs but may involve additional rotations to maintain balance.

4. **Red-Black Tree**:
   - Another self-balancing binary search tree with additional properties that ensure balance.
   - Red-black trees maintain balance using colorings and rotations.
   - In C++, you can implement red-black trees by augmenting regular binary search tree operations with color changes and rotations.

5. **Heap**:
   - A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
   - In a max-heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
   - In a min-heap, for any given node, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
   - In C++, you can implement heaps using arrays or binary trees.

6. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**:
   - A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where the keys are usually strings.
   - Each node of the trie represents a common prefix of some strings.
   - In C++, you can implement tries using nodes with links to child nodes representing the next character in the string.

These are just some of the common tree types and their implementations in C++. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may choose different types of trees or even design custom tree structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees - Height and Levels

In C++, you can implement algorithms to find the height and levels of a tree using various tree traversal techniques. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree along with functions to find its height and the number of levels:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Node structure for the binary tree
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        left = nullptr;
        right = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to find the height of a binary tree
int height(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    else {
        int leftHeight = height(root->left);
        int rightHeight = height(root->right);

        // Return the maximum of leftHeight and rightHeight, plus 1 for the current node
        return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}

// Function to find the number of levels in a binary tree
int levels(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    else {
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int levelCount = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int nodeCount = q.size(); // Number of nodes at current level

            // Process all nodes at this level and add their children to the queue
            while (nodeCount > 0) {
                Node* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                if (node->left)
                    q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right)
                    q.push(node->right);
                nodeCount--;
            }
            levelCount++; // Increment the level count after processing all nodes at the current level
        }

        return levelCount;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
    root->left->left = new Node(4);
    root->left->right = new Node(5);
    root->right->left = new Node(6);
    root->right->right = new Node(7);

    // Calculate and print the height and levels of the binary tree
    cout << "Height of the binary tree: " << height(root) << endl;
    cout << "Levels of the binary tree: " << levels(root) << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `Node` structure represents each node in the binary tree.
- The `height` function calculates the height of the tree recursively by finding the maximum height of the left and right subtrees and adding 1 for the current node.
- The `levels` function calculates the number of levels in the tree using a level-order traversal (BFS). It keeps track of the number of nodes at each level and increments the level count accordingly.
- In the `main` function, a sample binary tree is created, and the height and levels are calculated and printed.

Remember to deallocate the memory allocated for the nodes after their usage to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees - Terminology

Sure, let's delve into some terminology related to trees in the context of algorithms and data structures:

1. **Node**: The fundamental building block of a tree, consisting of a value and references to its child nodes, if any.

2. **Root**: The topmost node of a tree, serving as the entry point for accessing the tree's structure.

3. **Parent**: A node from which another node originates. Each node, except the root, has exactly one parent.

4. **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent.

6. **Leaf**: A node with no children, i.e., a node at the end of a branch.

7. **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child.

8. **Depth**: The level of a node in the tree. The root has depth 0, its children have depth 1, and so on.

9. **Height**: The maximum depth of any node in the tree. The height of a tree with a single node (the root) is 0.

10. **Subtree**: A tree formed by considering a node and all of its descendants, including the node itself.

11. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, conventionally referred to as the left child and the right child.

12. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than or equal to the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value. This structure facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

13. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. Common balanced trees include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.

14. **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

15. **Full Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

16. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree that is both full and complete, meaning all interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same depth.

17. **Traversal**: The process of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specific order. Common traversal methods include in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversals.

18. **In-order Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.

19. **Pre-order Traversal**: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.

20. **Post-order Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.

21. **Level-order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving down.

These terms provide a solid foundation for understanding and working with trees in the realm of algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees and Lowest Common Ancestors (Dynammic Programming)

Sure! Trees and Lowest Common Ancestors (LCA) are fundamental concepts in computer science and are frequently used in various algorithms and data structures. Let's break down these topics.

#### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each tree has a root node, and every node in the tree has zero or more child nodes. Some common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees, etc. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as family trees, file systems, organization charts, etc.

In C++, you can implement a simple binary tree like this:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

#### Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

The Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a tree is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants. The LCA can also be a node itself. It's a crucial concept in various tree-related algorithms and problems.

#### Dynamic Programming for LCA

Dynamic programming can be used to efficiently find the LCA of two nodes in a tree. One common approach is to preprocess the tree using techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate information about each node, such as their depths and ancestors. This preprocessing allows for faster queries of LCA later on.

Here's a high-level overview of a dynamic programming approach for finding the LCA:

1. **Preprocessing**: Traverse the tree and store necessary information about each node, like its depth and parent pointers.
2. **Querying LCA**: Given two nodes `p` and `q`, compare their depths. If they are at different depths, move the deeper node up the tree until both nodes are at the same level. Then, traverse upwards from both nodes simultaneously until finding a common ancestor.

Here's a simplified C++ implementation using dynamic programming:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*> parent;
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> depth;
        
        // Perform DFS to fill the parent and depth maps
        dfs(root, nullptr, 0, parent, depth);
        
        // Find LCA using dynamic programming
        while (p != q) {
            if (depth[p] > depth[q]) {
                p = parent[p];
            } else if (depth[q] > depth[p]) {
                q = parent[q];
            } else {
                p = parent[p];
                q = parent[q];
            }
        }
        
        return p; // or q, as they are now at the same level
    }
    
private:
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* par, int dep, unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*>& parent, unordered_map<TreeNode*, int>& depth) {
        if (!node) return;
        parent[node] = par;
        depth[node] = dep;
        dfs(node->left, node, dep + 1, parent, depth);
        dfs(node->right, node, dep + 1, parent, depth);
    }
};
```

This code performs a DFS to preprocess the tree, storing parent nodes and depths for each node. Then, it iteratively moves the deeper node towards the root until both nodes are at the same depth. Finally, it moves both nodes simultaneously towards the root until they meet at the LCA.

This is a basic example, and optimizations can be applied based on specific requirements and constraints.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees and Vectors

Certainly! Trees and vectors are fundamental data structures in computer science, and understanding them is crucial for any programmer. Let's break down each:

#### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each tree has a root node, and every node in the tree has zero or more child nodes. Here are some common types of trees:

1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
3. **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and maintaining efficient operations.
4. **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues.

Operations on trees include traversal (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order), insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing.

#### Vectors

Vectors, also known as dynamic arrays or ArrayLists in other languages, are sequential containers in C++ that store elements in contiguous memory locations. Vectors offer dynamic resizing, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed. Here are some key points about vectors:

- **Dynamic Size**: Vectors can resize themselves automatically when elements are added or removed, providing flexibility.
- **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed randomly in constant time using array-like indexing.
- **Efficient Iteration**: Iterating over elements in a vector is efficient due to contiguous memory allocation.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Insertion and deletion operations can be slower than at the beginning or end of the vector because elements may need to be shifted.

Vectors are part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, and they offer a wide range of operations and functionalities, including element access, modification, resizing, sorting, and searching.

In C++, trees are usually implemented using pointers, while vectors are provided as part of the standard library. Combining these two data structures can lead to efficient solutions for various programming problems, especially when dealing with data that has hierarchical relationships or when dynamic resizing is required.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees Definition and Properties

In C++, trees are a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science and programming. They're hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, with each node having a value and a set of references (or pointers) to its child nodes. Here's a breakdown of the key components and properties of trees:

#### Definition

A tree is a collection of nodes organized hierarchically. It consists of a root node, which is the topmost node in the hierarchy, and zero or more sub-trees, each of which is also a tree.

#### Components

1. **Node**: Each element in a tree is called a node. A node contains a value and may have references (pointers) to its child nodes.

2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree. It's the entry point for accessing the tree's data.

3. **Parent Node**: A node that has one or more child nodes.

4. **Child Node**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Leaf Node**: A node with no children.

6. **Internal Node**: A node with at least one child.

7. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a particular node. The depth of the root node is 0.

8. **Height**: The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf. The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

#### Properties

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Nodes are organized in a hierarchical manner, with each node having zero or more child nodes.

2. **One Root**: A tree has exactly one root node that serves as the entry point to access the entire tree.

3. **Connectedness**: Every node (except the root) is connected by exactly one edge to a unique parent node.

4. **Acyclic**: There are no cycles in a tree; that is, there is exactly one path between any two nodes.

5. **N-1 Edges**: A tree with 'n' nodes will have exactly 'n-1' edges.

6. **Height**: The height of a tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree.

7. **Balanced vs. Unbalanced**: Trees can be classified as balanced or unbalanced based on how evenly the nodes are distributed among levels.

8. **Binary Tree**: A special type of tree where each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

Trees are used in a wide range of applications, including representing hierarchical data structures like file systems, organizing data for efficient searching and sorting algorithms, and implementing various data structures like binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, etc. Understanding trees and their properties is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees Implementation

Sure! Implementing trees in C++ involves defining classes for different types of trees and their nodes, as well as methods for various tree operations. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node class for binary tree
class TreeNode {
public:
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    // Constructor
    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Binary tree class
class BinaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

    // Helper function for inserting a node recursively
    TreeNode* insertHelper(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertHelper(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertHelper(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    BinaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Method to insert a value into the binary tree
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertHelper(root, value);
    }

    // Helper function for searching a value recursively
    bool searchHelper(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }

        if (node->data == value) {
            return true;
        } else if (value < node->data) {
            return searchHelper(node->left, value);
        } else {
            return searchHelper(node->right, value);
        }
    }

    // Method to search for a value in the binary tree
    bool search(int value) {
        return searchHelper(root, value);
    }

    // Helper function for inorder traversal recursively
    void inorderHelper(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node != nullptr) {
            inorderHelper(node->left);
            std::cout << node->data << " ";
            inorderHelper(node->right);
        }
    }

    // Method to perform inorder traversal of the binary tree
    void inorderTraversal() {
        inorderHelper(root);
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    BinaryTree tree;

    // Inserting elements into the tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Perform inorder traversal
    std::cout << "Inorder traversal: ";
    tree.inorderTraversal();

    // Search for a value in the tree
    int searchValue = 40;
    if (tree.search(searchValue)) {
        std::cout << searchValue << " found in the tree." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << searchValue << " not found in the tree." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the implementation of a basic binary tree in C++. You can extend this implementation to include other tree types like binary search trees (BST), balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees, or n-ary trees by defining appropriate node and tree classes and implementing necessary methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees Vectors

In C++, a tree data structure can be implemented using various techniques, with one of the most common being the use of classes and pointers. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree using classes and vectors for dynamic memory allocation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Binary Tree class
class BinaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    // Constructor
    BinaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Destructor
    ~BinaryTree() {
        destroyTree(root);
    }

    // Function to recursively destroy the tree
    void destroyTree(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node) {
            destroyTree(node->left);
            destroyTree(node->right);
            delete node;
        }
    }

    // Function to insert a value into the binary tree
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Recursive function to insert a value into the binary tree
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Function to perform inorder traversal of the binary tree
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node) {
            inorderTraversal(node->left);
            cout << node->data << " ";
            inorderTraversal(node->right);
        }
    }

    // Function to print inorder traversal of the binary tree
    void printInorder() {
        inorderTraversal(root);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a binary tree
    BinaryTree tree;

    // Inserting values into the binary tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Printing inorder traversal of the binary tree
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary tree: ";
    tree.printInorder();

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements a basic binary tree with insertion and printing capabilities. Instead of using pointers for left and right child nodes, it uses vectors to store child nodes. You can extend this implementation by adding other functionalities like deletion, searching, etc., as per your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Binary Trees

Binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are extensively used in various algorithms and applications. They consist of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here's an overview of binary trees in C++:

#### Binary Tree Node

First, you define a structure for the node of the binary tree:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

#### Binary Tree Operations

1. **Insertion:**

```cpp
TreeNode* insert(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return new TreeNode(val);
    if (val < root->val)
        root->left = insert(root->left, val);
    else if (val > root->val)
        root->right = insert(root->right, val);
    return root;
}
```

1. **Search:**

```cpp
TreeNode* search(TreeNode* root, int val) {
    if (root == nullptr || root->val == val)
        return root;
    if (val < root->val)
        return search(root->left, val);
    return search(root->right, val);
}
```

1. **Deletion:**

```cpp
TreeNode* minValueNode(TreeNode* node) {
    TreeNode* current = node;
    while (current && current->left != nullptr)
        current = current->left;
    return current;
}

TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return root;
    if (key < root->val)
        root->left = deleteNode(root->left, key);
    else if (key > root->val)
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, key);
    else {
        if (root->left == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (root->right == nullptr) {
            TreeNode* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        TreeNode* temp = minValueNode(root->right);
        root->val = temp->val;
        root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->val);
    }
    return root;
}
```

1. **Traversal:**

   - **Inorder Traversal:** Left, Root, Right
   - **Preorder Traversal:** Root, Left, Right
   - **Postorder Traversal:** Left, Right, Root

```cpp
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        cout << root->val << " ";
        preorderTraversal(root->left);
        preorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        postorderTraversal(root->left);
        postorderTraversal(root->right);
        cout << root->val << " ";
    }
}
```

These are some basic operations on binary trees in C++. You can extend this further by implementing additional functionalities like tree height, checking if a binary tree is balanced, finding the lowest common ancestor, etc.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Breadth First Traversal

Breadth-first traversal is a technique used to visit all the nodes of a tree or graph level by level. In the context of trees, it starts at the root node, then moves to its child nodes, and so on, visiting nodes level by level.

In C++, you can implement breadth-first traversal of a tree using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes at each level. Here's a basic implementation using a queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Breadth-first traversal function
void breadthFirstTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        cout << current->data << " ";

        if (current->left != nullptr)
            q.push(current->left);

        if (current->right != nullptr)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform breadth-first traversal
    cout << "Breadth First Traversal: ";
    breadthFirstTraversal(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates breadth-first traversal of a binary tree. It uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level, starting from the root node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Depth First Traversal

Depth-first traversal is a fundamental technique used to explore tree-like data structures, such as binary trees or graphs. In a depth-first traversal, the algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

There are three common variants of depth-first traversal: pre-order, in-order, and post-order. Let's discuss each of them:

1. **Pre-order traversal**: In pre-order traversal, the algorithm visits the current node before its child nodes. This means that for each node, it first processes the node itself, then recursively processes its left subtree, and finally recursively processes its right subtree.

   Here's how pre-order traversal can be implemented in C++:

   ```cpp
   struct TreeNode {
       int val;
       TreeNode* left;
       TreeNode* right;
       TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
   };

   void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr) return;
       // Process current node
       cout << root->val << " ";
       // Recursive call for left subtree
       preOrderTraversal(root->left);
       // Recursive call for right subtree
       preOrderTraversal(root->right);
   }
   ```

2. **In-order traversal**: In in-order traversal, the algorithm visits the current node between its left and right child nodes. For binary search trees (BST), in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order.

   ```cpp
   void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr) return;
       // Recursive call for left subtree
       inOrderTraversal(root->left);
       // Process current node
       cout << root->val << " ";
       // Recursive call for right subtree
       inOrderTraversal(root->right);
   }
   ```

3. **Post-order traversal**: In post-order traversal, the algorithm visits the current node after its child nodes. This means that for each node, it first recursively processes its left subtree, then recursively processes its right subtree, and finally processes the node itself.

   ```cpp
   void postOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr) return;
       // Recursive call for left subtree
       postOrderTraversal(root->left);
       // Recursive call for right subtree
       postOrderTraversal(root->right);
       // Process current node
       cout << root->val << " ";
   }
   ```

These are the basic implementations of depth-first traversal algorithms in C++. They are widely used in various applications, including tree manipulation, searching, and sorting.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Level Width

In C++, to find the width of each level in a tree, you typically perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree while keeping track of the number of nodes at each level. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int widthOfLevel(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int maxWidth = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelWidth = q.size();
        maxWidth = max(maxWidth, levelWidth);

        // Process all nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelWidth; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            // Enqueue the children of the current node
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return maxWidth;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \   \
    //  4   5   6
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    cout << "Width of each level: " << widthOfLevel(root) << endl;

    // Free memory (not necessary in some environments but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the width of each level in the tree using a queue-based level-order traversal. It iterates through each level, counting the number of nodes at each level and updating the maximum width encountered so far. Finally, it returns the maximum width.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Measuring Level Width

Measuring the width of each level in a tree involves counting the number of nodes at each level. You can accomplish this using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. In C++, you can implement this with the help of queues. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Tree node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the width of each level in the tree
void levelWidth(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int width = q.size(); // Width of current level
        cout << width << " "; // Output the width

        // Enqueue children of all nodes at current level
        while (width--) {
            Node* current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (current->left)
                q.push(current->left);
            if (current->right)
                q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
    root->left->left = new Node(4);
    root->left->right = new Node(5);
    root->right->right = new Node(6);

    // Output the width of each level
    cout << "Width of each level: ";
    levelWidth(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program creates a binary tree and then calculates the width of each level using a BFS approach. It utilizes a queue to perform the breadth-first traversal. The `levelWidth` function iterates through each level, counting the number of nodes at each level and outputting the width.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Node Implementation

Sure! Implementing a tree node in C++ is relatively straightforward. You typically define a struct or a class representing a node, which contains the data and pointers to its children.

Here's a simple example of how you can implement a binary tree node in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int main() {
    // Creating nodes
    TreeNode<int>* root = new TreeNode<int>(10);
    TreeNode<int>* leftChild = new TreeNode<int>(5);
    TreeNode<int>* rightChild = new TreeNode<int>(15);

    // Connecting nodes
    root->left = leftChild;
    root->right = rightChild;

    // Accessing node data
    std::cout << "Root data: " << root->data << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Left child data: " << root->left->data << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Right child data: " << root->right->data << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root;
    delete leftChild;
    delete rightChild;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct that contains the data of type `T`, and pointers to left and right children.
- We create nodes using the `new` keyword.
- We connect the nodes by assigning the left and right pointers of the root node to the left and right child nodes, respectively.
- We access the data of nodes using the `->` operator.
- Finally, we clean up the memory using the `delete` keyword to avoid memory leaks.

Remember, this is a basic implementation. Depending on the type of tree (binary, binary search tree, AVL tree, etc.), you may need to add additional members and methods to the `TreeNode` struct or class.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Terminology

In the realm of algorithms and data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes connected by edges. Here are some fundamental terminologies related to trees in the context of C++:

1. **Node**: The basic building block of a tree, containing data and references (pointers) to its child nodes.

2. **Root**: The topmost node of the tree, representing the starting point for traversing the tree. A tree can have only one root node.

3. **Parent**: A node that has child nodes connected to it.

4. **Child**: Nodes directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Leaf**: A node that has no children. It resides at the bottommost level of the tree.

6. **Internal Node**: A node that has at least one child node.

7. **Siblings**: Nodes that share the same parent node.

8. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node. The depth of the root node is 0.

9. **Height**: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

10. **Subtree**: A tree formed by selecting a node (and all of its descendants) from a tree and treating it as the root of a new tree.

11. **Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

12. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

13. **Traversal**: The process of visiting all the nodes of a tree in a specific order. Common traversal algorithms include in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversal.

14. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property helps in maintaining efficient operations.

These are some of the key terminologies associated with trees in C++. Understanding these terms is essential for effectively working with tree-based algorithms and data structures.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Traverse By Breadth

Traversing a tree by breadth-first search (BFS) is a common way to explore or search through the nodes of a tree. It visits all the nodes at a particular depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Here's how you can implement breadth-first traversal in C++ using a queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void breadthFirstTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        std::cout << current->val << " ";

        if (current->left != nullptr)
            q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right != nullptr)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //        1
    //       / \
    //      2   3
    //     / \ / \
    //    4  5 6  7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    std::cout << "Breadth-First Traversal: ";
    breadthFirstTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code first creates a simple binary tree and then performs a breadth-first traversal starting from the root node. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited, pushing each node's children onto the queue as they are encountered.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Tree Width with Level Width

To find the width of a tree at each level, you can use a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. Here's how you can do it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Tree Node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the width of the tree at each level
vector<int> treeWidth(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return {};

    vector<int> widths;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelWidth = q.size(); // Number of nodes at current level
        widths.push_back(levelWidth);

        // Process all nodes at this level and enqueue their children
        while (levelWidth--) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return widths;
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    // Get the width of the tree at each level
    vector<int> widths = treeWidth(root);

    // Output the width at each level
    cout << "Width of the tree at each level: ";
    for (int width : widths) {
        cout << width << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a structure for tree nodes, along with a function `treeWidth` that calculates the width of the tree at each level using BFS traversal. Finally, in the `main` function, an example tree is created, and the width at each level is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of trees

In C++, trees are a fundamental data structure used in various algorithms and applications. There are several types of trees, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some common types:

1. **Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **AVL Tree**: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property ensures that the tree remains balanced, maintaining O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

4. **Red-Black Tree**: A red-black tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance using color properties and rotation operations. Red-black trees guarantee that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

5. **B-Tree**: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems where large amounts of data need to be stored efficiently on disk.

6. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix of its children. Tries are efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting strings, especially in applications like autocomplete and spell check.

7. **Heap**: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a binary heap, for example, if A is a parent node of B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B. This allows for efficient implementation of priority queues.

8. **Ternary Search Tree (TST)**: A ternary search tree is a type of trie (prefix tree) where each node has up to three children instead of the usual two in binary trees. Ternary search trees are useful for storing and searching a dictionary of strings efficiently.

These are just a few examples of the types of trees used in C++ programming. Each type has its own advantages and use cases, so choosing the right one depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are trees

In computer science, a tree is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node. Trees are recursive data structures composed of nodes. Each node contains a value and a list of references to its children nodes.

Here are some key concepts related to trees:

1. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, which does not have a parent.

2. **Node**: Each element in a tree structure that contains a value and references to its child nodes.

3. **Parent**: A node that has child nodes connected to it.

4. **Child**: Nodes directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.

5. **Leaf**: Nodes at the bottom of the tree hierarchy, which do not have any children.

6. **Subtree**: A tree structure within the main tree, rooted at some node.

7. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a particular node.

8. **Height**: The maximum depth of any node in the tree. It is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

9. **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

10. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree in which for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.

11. **Balanced Tree**: A tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. This ensures that the tree remains relatively balanced, improving the efficiency of various operations.

12. **Traversal**: A method for visiting all the nodes in a tree. Common traversal algorithms include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

Trees are used in various algorithms and applications, including organizing hierarchical data (e.g., file systems), implementing associative arrays (e.g., binary search trees), and providing efficient searching and sorting operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What is a Tree?

In computer science, a tree is a widely used data structure that resembles an inverted tree, with a root node at the top and branching out into multiple nodes, referred to as children nodes. Here are some key points about trees:

1. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, from which all other nodes are descended. It has no parent.

2. **Node**: Each element or entity in a tree is called a node. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node has exactly one parent node.

3. **Parent and Child Nodes**: In a tree, nodes are connected in a hierarchical manner. A node that is connected to another node directly above it is considered its parent, while the node connected directly below is its child.

4. **Leaf Node**: A leaf node is a node that does not have any children. It's at the "end" of a branch in the tree.

5. **Internal Node**: An internal node is any node in the tree that has at least one child.

6. **Degree of a Node**: The degree of a node in a tree is the number of children it has.

7. **Depth and Height**: The depth of a node in a tree is the length of the path from the root to that node. The height of a node is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root node.

8. **Binary Trees**: A binary tree is a special type of tree in which each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

Trees are used in various applications such as hierarchical data representation (like file systems), searching algorithms (like binary search trees), and in implementing advanced data structures like AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. They provide efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and searching when appropriately balanced and utilized.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Why Do You Need Balanced Trees?

Balanced trees, such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees, are crucial in computer science and programming for several reasons:

1. **Efficient Searching, Insertion, and Deletion**: Balanced trees maintain their height in such a way that the worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations remains logarithmic (O(log n)). This makes them highly efficient for handling large datasets.

2. **Preventing Degeneration**: In unbalanced trees like a linear linked list or a skewed binary tree, the time complexity for operations can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements. Balancing techniques ensure that the tree remains balanced, preventing such degeneration.

3. **Optimized Performance**: Balanced trees provide a balance between space efficiency and time efficiency. While they may consume slightly more memory due to additional pointers or metadata, they guarantee faster operations, making them suitable for applications where performance is critical.

4. **Support for Range Queries**: Some balanced trees, like B-trees, are particularly useful for range queries and operations involving intervals. They maintain an ordered structure that facilitates efficient range searches.

5. **Concurrency and Transaction Management**: In database systems and concurrent environments, balanced trees play a crucial role in ensuring efficient transaction management and concurrency control. They provide a foundation for implementing data structures like transaction logs and indexing mechanisms.

6. **Consistent Performance**: Unlike hash tables, which might suffer from occasional worst-case scenarios leading to O(n) time complexity, balanced trees offer consistent performance guarantees across different datasets and operations.

In summary, balanced trees are essential in algorithm and data structure design because they offer efficient, reliable, and predictable performance for various operations on dynamic datasets, making them a fundamental building block in computer science and software engineering.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Why Tree?

Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science with various applications and advantages:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Trees are ideal for representing hierarchical relationships. For instance, file systems on a computer, organizational charts in a company, or the structure of a webpage in HTML all can be represented as trees.

2. **Efficient Searching**: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees. This makes them suitable for implementing dictionary operations like search, insert, and delete.

3. **Ordered Data**: Binary Search Trees store data in sorted order, which makes in-order traversal yield elements in sorted order. This property is useful in applications where sorted data is required, like finding the k-th smallest or largest element in a set.

4. **Efficient Operations**: Various operations like finding the minimum/maximum element, finding the successor/predecessor of an element, and range queries can be performed efficiently on trees.

5. **Balanced Trees**: Balanced trees like AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees ensure that the height of the tree remains balanced, resulting in guaranteed time complexities for operations, preventing worst-case scenarios.

6. **Space Efficiency**: Trees occupy less space compared to other data structures like hash tables since they don't require as much overhead space. This can be crucial in memory-constrained environments.

7. **Versatility**: Trees can be modified and extended to suit different requirements. There are various types of trees such as Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, B-trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Segment Trees, and so on, each designed to optimize specific operations or scenarios.

8. **Graph Representation**: Trees are a specific type of graph without cycles. They can be used to represent graph structures efficiently, especially for algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's for finding Minimum Spanning Trees.

In C++, you have the flexibility to implement trees using pointers or smart pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation and efficient manipulation of tree structures. Overall, trees offer a versatile and efficient way to organize and manipulate data in a wide range of applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): ZigZag Level Order Traversal

Zigzag level order traversal is a traversal method for binary trees where you visit the nodes level by level, alternating the direction in which you visit each level. Here's a C++ implementation using a queue and a stack:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    if (root == nullptr) return result;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    bool leftToRight = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        vector<int> level(size);
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int index = (leftToRight) ? i : (size - 1 - i);
            level[index] = node->val;
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
        result.push_back(level);
        leftToRight = !leftToRight;
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Get the zigzag level order traversal
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagTraversal = zigzagLevelOrder(root);

    // Output the result
    for (const auto& level : zigzagTraversal) {
        for (int val : level) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code does a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree, but it alternates the direction in which it reads each level, going from left to right on odd levels and from right to left on even levels.

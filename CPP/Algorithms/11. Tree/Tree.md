### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure: Tree: Theory

A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that emulates a tree structure with a set of linked nodes.

#### Basic Terminology

1. **Node**: The fundamental part of a tree that stores data.
2. **Root**: The topmost node in a tree, where the tree originates. There is only one root node in a tree.
3. **Parent**: A node that has one or more children.
4. **Child**: A node that descends from another node (parent).
5. **Leaf**: A node that does not have any children.
6. **Sibling**: Nodes that share the same parent.
7. **Edge**: The connection between two nodes.
8. **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
9. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to the node.
10. **Height**: The length of the path from the node to the deepest leaf.
11. **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.

#### Types of Trees

1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where for each node, the left subtree has values less than the node's value and the right subtree has values greater than the node's value.
3. **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.
4. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where nodes have an extra bit for color (red or black) to ensure the tree remains balanced.
5. **B-Tree**: A self-balancing search tree where nodes can have multiple children and keys, optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.
6. **Heap**: A complete binary tree where each node's value is greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) the values of its children.
7. **Trie**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where keys are usually strings.

#### Tree Operations

1. **Insertion**: Adding a node to the tree.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a specific order. Common traversals include:
   - **In-order Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, the root, and then the right subtree.
   - **Pre-order Traversal**: Visit the root, the left subtree, and then the right subtree.
   - **Post-order Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, the right subtree, and then the root.
   - **Level-order Traversal**: Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom.

#### Tree Properties

1. **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
2. **Complete Tree**: All levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
3. **Full Tree**: Every node other than the leaves has two children.

#### Conclusion

Trees are a fundamental part of many algorithms and data structures. Understanding their properties, types, and operations is crucial for solving a wide range of computational problems efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Building a Tree

Sure! Building a tree in C++ involves defining a structure for a tree node and then implementing functions to manipulate and construct the tree. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure for a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to insert a node into the tree
void insert(TreeNode* root, int parentVal, int childVal) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    if (root->val == parentVal) {
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(childVal);
        root->children.push_back(newNode);
    } else {
        for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
            insert(child, parentVal, childVal);
        }
    }
}

// Function to print the tree in preorder traversal
void printPreorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    cout << root->val << " ";
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        printPreorder(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create the root node
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);

    // Insert nodes into the tree
    insert(root, 1, 2);
    insert(root, 1, 3);
    insert(root, 1, 4);
    insert(root, 2, 5);
    insert(root, 2, 6);

    // Print the tree
    cout << "Preorder traversal of the tree: ";
    printPreorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `TreeNode` represents each node of the tree. It contains the node's value (`val`) and a vector of pointers to its children.
- The `insert` function inserts a new node with the given value as a child of the node with the given parent value.
- The `printPreorder` function performs a preorder traversal of the tree and prints the values of the nodes.
- In the `main` function, a tree is created with a root node having a value of 1, and nodes are inserted into the tree accordingly.
- Finally, the preorder traversal of the tree is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Cartesian Tree

A Cartesian Tree is a binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers. Each node in the Cartesian Tree represents an element from the sequence, and the tree has the property that the parent of any node \( N \) in the tree has a value greater than \( N \)'s value and is closest to \( N \) in the left side of the sequence. In other words, it's a binary tree representation of the given sequence with a heap property.

Here's how you can construct a Cartesian Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode *left, *right;
    TreeNode(int val) : value(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* constructCartesianTree(const vector<int>& arr) {
    stack<TreeNode*> stk;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        TreeNode* current = new TreeNode(arr[i]);

        while (!stk.empty() && stk.top()->value > arr[i]) {
            current->left = stk.top();
            stk.pop();
        }

        if (!stk.empty()) {
            stk.top()->right = current;
        }

        stk.push(current);
    }

    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    while (!stk.empty()) {
        root = stk.top();
        stk.pop();
    }

    return root;
}

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->value << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {3, 2, 6, 1, 9, 5, 7};
    TreeNode* root = constructCartesianTree(arr);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed Cartesian Tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code constructs a Cartesian Tree from a given sequence represented by a vector of integers. It uses a stack to efficiently keep track of the current subtree being constructed. Finally, it returns the root of the constructed Cartesian Tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Tree from PostOrder and Inorder Traversal

Constructing a binary tree from its inorder and postorder traversals is a classic problem in computer science. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder) {
        // Create a map to store the indices of elements in inorder traversal for quick lookup
        unordered_map<int, int> inorder_map;
        for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
            inorder_map[inorder[i]] = i;
        }
        // Start the recursive construction
        return buildTreeHelper(inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1, postorder, 0, postorder.size() - 1, inorder_map);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& inorder, int inStart, int inEnd,
                              vector<int>& postorder, int postStart, int postEnd,
                              unordered_map<int, int>& inorder_map) {
        if (inStart > inEnd || postStart > postEnd) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // The last element of postorder is the root
        int rootVal = postorder[postEnd];
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
        
        // Find the index of root in inorder traversal
        int rootIndexInorder = inorder_map[rootVal];
        
        // Calculate the size of left subtree
        int leftSubtreeSize = rootIndexInorder - inStart;
        
        // Recursively build left and right subtrees
        root->left = buildTreeHelper(inorder, inStart, rootIndexInorder - 1,
                                     postorder, postStart, postStart + leftSubtreeSize - 1,
                                     inorder_map);
        root->right = buildTreeHelper(inorder, rootIndexInorder + 1, inEnd,
                                      postorder, postStart + leftSubtreeSize, postEnd - 1,
                                      inorder_map);
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Utility function to print the inorder traversal of a binary tree
void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    printInorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    printInorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};
    vector<int> postorder = {9, 15, 7, 20, 3};
    
    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* root = sol.buildTree(inorder, postorder);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Solution` class with a `buildTree` method that takes the inorder and postorder traversal arrays as input and returns the root of the constructed binary tree. The `buildTreeHelper` method is a recursive helper function to construct the tree. Finally, there's a `printInorder` function to print the inorder traversal of the constructed tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Construct Tree from PreOrder and Inorder Traversal

Constructing a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals is a classic problem in computer science and is commonly solved using recursion. Here's a C++ implementation of the algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        unordered_map<int, int> inorder_map;
        for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
            inorder_map[inorder[i]] = i;
        }
        return buildTreeHelper(preorder, 0, preorder.size() - 1, inorder, 0, inorder.size() - 1, inorder_map);
    }
    
    TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& preorder, int preStart, int preEnd, vector<int>& inorder, int inStart, int inEnd, unordered_map<int, int>& inorder_map) {
        if (preStart > preEnd || inStart > inEnd) return nullptr;
        
        int rootVal = preorder[preStart];
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
        
        int rootIndexInorder = inorder_map[rootVal];
        int leftSubtreeSize = rootIndexInorder - inStart;
        
        root->left = buildTreeHelper(preorder, preStart + 1, preStart + leftSubtreeSize, inorder, inStart, rootIndexInorder - 1, inorder_map);
        root->right = buildTreeHelper(preorder, preStart + leftSubtreeSize + 1, preEnd, inorder, rootIndexInorder + 1, inEnd, inorder_map);
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Function to print the inorder traversal of a binary tree
void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> preorder = {3, 9, 20, 15, 7};
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};
    
    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* root = solution.buildTree(preorder, inorder);
    
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a helper function `buildTreeHelper` to recursively construct the tree. It also utilizes a hashmap to store the indices of elements in the inorder traversal for efficient lookup during tree construction. Finally, it provides a simple main function to demonstrate the usage of the `buildTree` function and prints the inorder traversal of the constructed tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Constructing and Evaluating an Expression Tree

Constructing and evaluating an expression tree in C++ involves parsing an infix expression, converting it to a postfix expression, building the expression tree, and then evaluating the tree. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Parsing Infix Expression**:
   - Parse the infix expression into tokens (operands, operators, parentheses).
   - Use a stack to handle precedence and parentheses.

2. **Converting to Postfix Expression**:
   - Use the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert infix expression to postfix.
   - Maintain a stack to store operators temporarily.

3. **Building the Expression Tree**:
   - Traverse the postfix expression.
   - For each token:
     - If it's an operand, create a leaf node and push it onto the stack.
     - If it's an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, create a new node with the operator as its value, and push it back onto the stack.

4. **Evaluating the Expression Tree**:
   - Use recursive traversal (post-order traversal) to evaluate the expression tree.
   - For each node:
     - If it's an operand, return its value.
     - If it's an operator, apply the operator to the values of its children.

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    string data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(string val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool isOperator(char c) {
    return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
}

int precedence(char op) {
    if (op == '+' || op == '-')
        return 1;
    if (op == '*' || op == '/')
        return 2;
    return 0;
}

TreeNode* buildExpressionTree(const string& postfix) {
    stack<TreeNode*> st;
    for (char c : postfix) {
        if (isspace(c))
            continue;
        if (isalnum(c)) {
            st.push(new TreeNode(string(1, c)));
        } else if (isOperator(c)) {
            TreeNode* right = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* left = st.top(); st.pop();
            TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            root->left = left;
            root->right = right;
            st.push(root);
        }
    }
    return st.top();
}

int evaluate(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return 0;
    if (root->data.length() == 1 && isOperator(root->data[0])) {
        int leftVal = evaluate(root->left);
        int rightVal = evaluate(root->right);
        switch (root->data[0]) {
            case '+': return leftVal + rightVal;
            case '-': return leftVal - rightVal;
            case '*': return leftVal * rightVal;
            case '/': return leftVal / rightVal;
        }
    }
    return stoi(root->data);
}

int main() {
    string infix = "5 + (3 * 4)";
    string postfix;
    stack<char> operators;
    for (char c : infix) {
        if (isspace(c))
            continue;
        if (isdigit(c)) {
            postfix += c;
        } else if (c == '(') {
            operators.push(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            while (!operators.empty() && operators.top() != '(') {
                postfix += operators.top();
                operators.pop();
            }
            operators.pop(); // Remove '('
        } else if (isOperator(c)) {
            while (!operators.empty() && precedence(operators.top()) >= precedence(c)) {
                postfix += operators.top();
                operators.pop();
            }
            operators.push(c);
        }
    }
    while (!operators.empty()) {
        postfix += operators.top();
        operators.pop();
    }
    TreeNode* root = buildExpressionTree(postfix);
    cout << "Postfix: " << postfix << endl;
    cout << "Result: " << evaluate(root) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation can handle basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses. You can extend it to support more operators or functions if needed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Counting Trees

Counting trees in computer science often involves understanding different types of tree structures and their properties. In C++, you can implement algorithms to count various aspects of trees, such as the number of nodes, the height of the tree, or the number of different types of trees in a given structure.

Here's a simple example of how you can count the number of nodes in a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to count the number of nodes in a binary tree
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Count the number of nodes
    int numNodes = countNodes(root);
    std::cout << "Number of nodes in the binary tree: " << numNodes << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `countNodes` function recursively counts the number of nodes in the binary tree. We start from the root node and recursively count the nodes in the left subtree and the right subtree, adding 1 for the current node.

This is just a basic example, and there are many other operations and properties you can compute for trees in C++, depending on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Counting Trees Bottom Up

Counting trees bottom-up typically involves dynamic programming. You start from the simplest case and build up towards the desired solution. In the context of counting trees, this often means starting with the base cases (e.g., when there are no nodes or just one node) and then incrementally adding nodes to generate larger trees.

Here's a basic approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to count the number of unique binary trees with n nodes
int countTrees(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return 1;

    vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of nodes in the binary tree: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Number of unique binary trees with " << n << " nodes: " << countTrees(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `countTrees(n)` calculates the number of unique binary trees with `n` nodes.
- We use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique binary trees with `i` nodes.
- The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, and for each `i`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the previously calculated values in `dp`.
- The formula `dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1]` calculates the number of trees when `j` nodes are on the left subtree and `i - j - 1` nodes are on the right subtree, considering all possible values of `j`.
- Finally, `dp[n]` gives us the answer for `n` nodes.

This approach ensures that we don't recalculate the number of unique trees for the same number of nodes, thereby optimizing the solution.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : Generic Trees

In C++, generic trees are structures where each node can have an arbitrary number of children. Unlike binary trees where each node has at most two children, generic trees allow nodes to have multiple children. Here's a basic implementation of a generic tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the generic tree
template<typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(T val) : data(val) {}
};

// Generic tree class
template<typename T>
class GenericTree {
private:
    TreeNode<T>* root;

public:
    GenericTree(T val) {
        root = new TreeNode<T>(val);
    }

    // Function to insert a new node as a child of a given node
    void insert(TreeNode<T>* parent, T val) {
        TreeNode<T>* newNode = new TreeNode<T>(val);
        parent->children.push_back(newNode);
    }

    // Function to print the tree (Depth-First Traversal)
    void print(TreeNode<T>* node, int depth = 0) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        // Print the current node
        for (int i = 0; i < depth; ++i)
            cout << "  ";
        cout << node->data << endl;

        // Recursively print children
        for (TreeNode<T>* child : node->children)
            print(child, depth + 1);
    }

    // Wrapper function to print the entire tree
    void print() {
        print(root);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a generic tree
    GenericTree<int> tree(1);
    TreeNode<int>* root = tree.root;

    // Insert some nodes
    tree.insert(root, 2);
    tree.insert(root, 3);
    tree.insert(root->children[0], 4);
    tree.insert(root->children[1], 5);
    tree.insert(root->children[1], 6);

    // Print the tree
    tree.print();

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and a `GenericTree` class. Each node has a data field and a vector to store its children. The `insert` function inserts a new node as a child of a given parent node. The `print` function performs a Depth-First Traversal to print the tree structure. Finally, in the `main` function, a simple example of a generic tree is created and printed.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Degree of Node and Tree

In algorithms and data structures, the degree of a node refers to the number of edges incident to that node. For a tree, which is a special kind of graph with no cycles, the degree of a node is crucial in understanding its structure and properties.

In the context of a tree:

1. **Degree of a Node**: The degree of a node in a tree is the number of children it has. For a binary tree, a node can have at most two children, so the degree of a node in a binary tree is either 0, 1, or 2.

2. **Degree of a Tree**: The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of its nodes. In a binary tree, for example, the maximum degree is 2 because each node can have at most two children.

Here's a brief example of how you might implement these concepts in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition of a Node in a binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to calculate the degree of a node
int nodeDegree(TreeNode* node) {
    if (node == nullptr)
        return 0;
    int degree = 0;
    if (node->left != nullptr)
        degree++;
    if (node->right != nullptr)
        degree++;
    return degree;
}

// Function to calculate the degree of a tree
int treeDegree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;
    int maxDegree = nodeDegree(root);
    if (root->left != nullptr) {
        int leftDegree = treeDegree(root->left);
        maxDegree = max(maxDegree, leftDegree);
    }
    if (root->right != nullptr) {
        int rightDegree = treeDegree(root->right);
        maxDegree = max(maxDegree, rightDegree);
    }
    return maxDegree;
}

int main() {
    // Example of a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Degree of node 1: " << nodeDegree(root) << endl;
    cout << "Degree of tree: " << treeDegree(root) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `nodeDegree` calculates the degree of a node, and `treeDegree` calculates the degree of the entire tree. The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree, with each node having a value and pointers to its left and right children.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Depth First Search on Trees

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used to traverse or search through tree and graph data structures. In the context of trees, DFS starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here's an example implementation of DFS on a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class BinaryTree {
public:
    // Function to perform DFS recursively
    void dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        // Process the current node
        cout << node->val << " ";

        // Recursive call for left and right subtrees
        dfs(node->left);
        dfs(node->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    BinaryTree bt;
    cout << "Depth First Search traversal of the binary tree: ";
    bt.dfs(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // This step is crucial to prevent memory leaks
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `dfs()` is a recursive function that traverses the binary tree in DFS fashion. It prints the value of each node as it visits them. The `main()` function creates a binary tree and calls `dfs()` on its root node to perform DFS traversal.

Remember to properly deallocate memory allocated for tree nodes after using them to avoid memory leaks.

This code demonstrates a simple implementation of DFS on a binary tree. You can modify it to suit your specific requirements, such as handling different types of trees or performing additional operations during traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Depth First Search Tree and Backedges

Depth First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's commonly used to traverse or search through graph or tree structures. In the context of trees, DFS helps in traversing and exploring all the nodes of a tree.

Here's a basic implementation of DFS for traversing a tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define a node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    vector<Node*> children;
    Node(int value) : data(value) {}
};

// Depth First Search function
void DFS(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    
    cout << root->data << " "; // Process the current node
    
    // Traverse all the children of the current node recursively
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        DFS(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));

    cout << "DFS Traversal of the tree: ";
    DFS(root);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `Node` structure to represent each node of the tree. Each node has an integer value and a vector of child nodes.
- The `DFS` function traverses the tree recursively. It starts from the root node and explores each child node in depth-first manner.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample tree and call the `DFS` function to traverse it.

Now, about backedges in DFS: In a DFS traversal, a backedge is an edge that connects a node to one of its ancestors in the DFS tree. These edges indicate the existence of a cycle in the graph or tree.

To detect backedges during DFS traversal, you can maintain additional information such as the traversal state of each node (e.g., whether a node is being visited, visited, or unvisited). When traversing an edge `(u, v)` from node `u` to node `v`, if `v` is already being visited (indicating it's in the current DFS path), and `v` is not the parent of `u`, then `(u, v)` is a backedge.

You can modify the DFS function to detect backedges by incorporating such logic. If you need more specific guidance on detecting backedges or have any other questions, feel free to ask!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): difference Height Level Depth tree

In the context of trees, particularly in computer science and programming, the terms "height," "level," and "depth" refer to different characteristics of the tree structure. Let's break down each term:

1. **Height of a Tree:**
   - The height of a tree is the maximum distance from the root node to any leaf node in the tree.
   - In other words, it's the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
   - For example, in a binary tree, the height is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf.

2. **Level of a Node:**
   - The level of a node in a tree is its distance from the root node.
   - The root node is considered to be at level 0, and its immediate children are at level 1, their children are at level 2, and so on.
   - For example, nodes at the same depth (or distance from the root) have the same level.

3. **Depth of a Node:**
   - The depth of a node is the distance from the root of the tree to that particular node.
   - Unlike the level, which refers to the position of a node relative to the root, depth is an absolute measure.
   - The root node has a depth of 0, its children have a depth of 1, their children have a depth of 2, and so on.

In summary, while height refers to the overall size of the tree, level and depth refer to characteristics of individual nodes within the tree. Height measures the longest path from the root to a leaf, level measures the distance of a node from the root, and depth measures the distance of a node from the root along the path to that node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Distance Tree

A "Distance Tree" isn't a standard term in the realm of algorithms and data structures, but I can offer some insights on what it might refer to based on common concepts.

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   A minimum spanning tree is a tree that spans all the vertices of a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight. This tree minimizes the total cost of the edges while connecting all the vertices. Algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's can be used to find the minimum spanning tree.

2. **Shortest Path Tree**:
   This could refer to a tree structure derived from a graph where each node represents a vertex and each edge represents a shortest path between two vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to find shortest paths and then construct such a tree.

3. **Bounded-Distance Tree**:
   In this concept, you might construct a tree such that the maximum distance between any two nodes in the tree is bounded by a certain value. This could be useful in various network routing or clustering algorithms.

4. **Distance Oracles**:
   A distance oracle is a data structure designed to quickly answer distance queries in a graph. It precomputes and stores information about distances between pairs of vertices, allowing fast retrieval of distances during query time.

5. **Hierarchical Clustering Tree**:
   In hierarchical clustering, a distance tree can be constructed where the nodes represent clusters at various levels of similarity, and the edges represent the distance between these clusters.

If you provide more context or details, I can offer a more specific explanation or implementation in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Expression Tree

An Expression Tree is a specific type of binary tree used to represent expressions. Each node in the tree represents either an operand or an operator. Here's how you can implement an Expression Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Node definition for the Expression Tree
struct TreeNode {
    string value;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(string val) : value(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to check if a given character is an operator
bool isOperator(char c) {
    return (c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/');
}

// Function to construct Expression Tree from postfix expression
TreeNode* constructExpressionTree(string postfix) {
    stack<TreeNode*> stack;
    
    for (char c : postfix) {
        if (!isOperator(c)) {
            TreeNode* operandNode = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            stack.push(operandNode);
        } else {
            TreeNode* rightOperand = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            TreeNode* leftOperand = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            
            TreeNode* operatorNode = new TreeNode(string(1, c));
            operatorNode->left = leftOperand;
            operatorNode->right = rightOperand;
            
            stack.push(operatorNode);
        }
    }
    
    return stack.top();
}

// Function to evaluate Expression Tree recursively
int evaluateExpressionTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return 0;
    if (!root->left && !root->right)
        return stoi(root->value);
    
    int leftVal = evaluateExpressionTree(root->left);
    int rightVal = evaluateExpressionTree(root->right);
    
    if (root->value == "+")
        return leftVal + rightVal;
    else if (root->value == "-")
        return leftVal - rightVal;
    else if (root->value == "*")
        return leftVal * rightVal;
    else
        return leftVal / rightVal;
}

int main() {
    string postfixExpression = "34*2+";
    
    TreeNode* root = constructExpressionTree(postfixExpression);
    
    cout << "Evaluation of the expression tree: " << evaluateExpressionTree(root) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the structure of a TreeNode, which holds a string value representing either an operand or an operator. The `constructExpressionTree` function constructs the expression tree from a postfix expression, and the `evaluateExpressionTree` function recursively evaluates the expression tree. Finally, the `main` function demonstrates the usage of these functions by constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression and evaluating it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Fenwick Trees

Fenwick trees, also known as Binary Indexed Trees (BIT), are a data structure that efficiently supports two operations on an array of numbers:

1. **Point Update**: Modify the value of an element at a specific index.
2. **Range Query**: Compute the prefix sum of elements up to a specific index.

Here's how they work:

#### Structure

A Fenwick tree is represented as an array `BIT[]` of the same size as the original array. Each element `BIT[i]` stores the sum of a specific range of elements in the original array.

#### Construction

To construct a Fenwick tree for an array `arr[]`, we start with an array initialized with all zeroes. Then, we update the Fenwick tree by adding each element of `arr[]` to its corresponding range in the tree. The update operation for element `arr[i]` at index `i` involves updating `BIT[j]` for all `j` such that `j` is formed by flipping the least significant bit of `i`. This is done by adding `arr[i]` to `BIT[j]`.

#### Update Operation

To update the value of an element `arr[i]` in the original array, we update the Fenwick tree as follows:

```cpp
void update(int index, int value) {
    while (index <= n) {
        BIT[index] += value;
        index += (index & -index); // Move to the next node
    }
}
```

#### Query Operation

To compute the prefix sum up to index `idx`, we traverse the Fenwick tree, adding up the values of all nodes that contribute to the sum:

```cpp
int query(int idx) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (idx > 0) {
        sum += BIT[idx];
        idx -= (idx & -idx); // Move to the parent node
    }
    return sum;
}
```

#### Example Usage

Let's say we have an array `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`. The Fenwick tree for this array would be `BIT[] = {0, 1, 3, 3, 10, 5}`.

#### Update

To update `arr[2]` to `6`, we call `update(2, 3)`. This would result in `BIT[] = {0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 5}`.

#### Query

To find the sum of elements up to index `4`, we call `query(4)`, which returns `10`.

Fenwick trees are efficient and have a time complexity of O(log n) for both update and query operations, where n is the size of the array. They are particularly useful when the number of updates and queries is dynamic and unpredictable.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Find Bottom Left Tree Value

To find the bottom-left value of a binary tree in C++, you can perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first search) and return the leftmost value of the last level encountered. Here's a sample implementation using a queue for level-order traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int leftmost = root->val;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        leftmost = q.front()->val; // Update leftmost with the current level's leftmost node
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return leftmost;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);

    cout << "Bottom left value: " << findBottomLeftValue(root) << endl;

    // Remember to free the dynamically allocated memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `findBottomLeftValue` function takes the root of the binary tree as input and returns the value of the bottom-left node.
- We perform a level-order traversal using a queue. We traverse each level from left to right and update the `leftmost` variable with the leftmost node of each level.
- Finally, we return the `leftmost` value, which holds the value of the bottom-left node.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Finding Nodes Trees

Sure, I can help you with that! In C++, you can implement algorithms to find nodes in trees using various traversal techniques like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here's a basic example of how you can find a node in a binary tree using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Depth First Search (DFS) to find a node in a binary tree
TreeNode* findNodeDFS(TreeNode* root, int target) {
    if (root == nullptr) return nullptr;

    if (root->val == target) return root;

    TreeNode* leftResult = findNodeDFS(root->left, target);
    if (leftResult != nullptr) return leftResult;

    TreeNode* rightResult = findNodeDFS(root->right, target);
    if (rightResult != nullptr) return rightResult;

    return nullptr;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    int target = 5;
    TreeNode* result = findNodeDFS(root, target);

    if (result != nullptr) {
        cout << "Node with value " << target << " found in the tree." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Node with value " << target << " not found in the tree." << endl;
    }

    // Free memory (not necessary in some environments)
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `findNodeDFS` is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search traversal of the binary tree. It returns a pointer to the node with the given value if found, otherwise, it returns `nullptr`. You can modify this function according to your tree structure and search requirements.

Remember to handle memory deallocation properly, especially if you're dynamically allocating memory for tree nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Generating Tree from Traversals

Generating a tree from its traversals, especially in the context of binary trees, typically involves using the inorder and preorder traversals. These traversals provide information about the order in which nodes are visited during tree traversal. Here's a high-level overview of how you can generate a binary tree from its inorder and preorder traversals in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* buildTreeHelper(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder, int preorderStart, int preorderEnd, int inorderStart, int inorderEnd, unordered_map<int, int>& inorderMap) {
    if (preorderStart > preorderEnd || inorderStart > inorderEnd) return nullptr;

    int rootValue = preorder[preorderStart];
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootValue);

    int rootIndexInInorder = inorderMap[rootValue];
    int numsLeft = rootIndexInInorder - inorderStart;

    root->left = buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, preorderStart + 1, preorderStart + numsLeft, inorderStart, rootIndexInInorder - 1, inorderMap);
    root->right = buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, preorderStart + numsLeft + 1, preorderEnd, rootIndexInInorder + 1, inorderEnd, inorderMap);

    return root;
}

TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
    if (preorder.empty() || inorder.empty() || preorder.size() != inorder.size()) return nullptr;

    unordered_map<int, int> inorderMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < inorder.size(); ++i) {
        inorderMap[inorder[i]] = i;
    }

    return buildTreeHelper(preorder, inorder, 0, preorder.size() - 1, 0, inorder.size() - 1, inorderMap);
}

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root) {
        printInorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        printInorder(root->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> preorder = {3, 9, 20, 15, 7};
    vector<int> inorder = {9, 3, 15, 20, 7};

    TreeNode* root = buildTree(preorder, inorder);

    cout << "Inorder traversal of the constructed tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `buildTreeHelper` is a recursive function that constructs the binary tree recursively using the preorder and inorder traversals.
- `buildTree` is a wrapper function that initializes the map and calls the helper function.
- `printInorder` is a helper function to print the inorder traversal of the constructed tree for verification.

This code assumes that the input traversals are valid and that the tree does not contain duplicate values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Height of a Tree

Calculating the height of a tree in C++ typically involves a recursive traversal of the tree. The height of a tree is defined as the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for max function

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to calculate the height of a tree
int treeHeight(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return -1; // Height of an empty tree is -1
    } else {
        // Recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = treeHeight(root->left);
        int rightHeight = treeHeight(root->right);
        
        // Height of the tree is 1 plus the maximum of the heights of the left and right subtrees
        return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    
    // Calculate and print the height of the tree
    cout << "Height of the tree: " << treeHeight(root) << endl;
    
    // Clean up memory (not necessary in this small example, but good practice)
    // This should be done using a proper tree deletion function in real scenarios
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code first defines a structure `TreeNode` to represent each node in the tree. Then, it defines a function `treeHeight` to calculate the height of the tree recursively. Finally, in the `main` function, a sample tree is created and its height is calculated and printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Huffman's Codes - Building Huffman Tree

Huffman's algorithm is a popular method for generating minimum-redundancy prefix codes. It's often used for data compression. To build a Huffman tree, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of each character in the input data.
2. **Create Nodes**: Create a leaf node for each character and assign its frequency as the weight of the node.
3. **Build Priority Queue**: Put all the leaf nodes into a priority queue (min heap) based on their frequencies.
4. **Build Huffman Tree**: While there is more than one node in the queue, extract the two nodes with the lowest frequency, create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes' frequencies, and make the two nodes children of the new node. Insert the new node into the priority queue.
5. **Root of Huffman Tree**: The remaining node in the queue is the root of the Huffman tree.

Here's a simplified implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Node structure for Huffman Tree
struct Node {
    char data;
    unsigned frequency;
    Node *left, *right;

    Node(char data, unsigned frequency) : data(data), frequency(frequency), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Comparison function for priority queue
struct compare {
    bool operator()(Node* l, Node* r) {
        return (l->frequency > r->frequency);
    }
};

// Build Huffman Tree
Node* buildHuffmanTree(string data, int freq[], int size) {
    // Create leaf nodes for each character
    priority_queue<Node*, vector<Node*>, compare> minHeap;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        if (freq[i] > 0) {
            minHeap.push(new Node(data[i], freq[i]));
        }
    }

    // Build Huffman Tree
    while (minHeap.size() != 1) {
        Node *left = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();
        Node *right = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();

        Node *internalNode = new Node('$', left->frequency + right->frequency);
        internalNode->left = left;
        internalNode->right = right;

        minHeap.push(internalNode);
    }

    return minHeap.top();
}

// Utility function to print codes
void printCodes(Node* root, string code) {
    if (!root)
        return;

    if (root->data != '$')
        cout << root->data << ": " << code << endl;

    printCodes(root->left, code + "0");
    printCodes(root->right, code + "1");
}

int main() {
    string data = "abcdef";
    int freq[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45};
    int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    Node* root = buildHuffmanTree(data, freq, size);

    cout << "Huffman Codes are:\n";
    printCodes(root, "");

    return 0;
}
```

This code will build a Huffman tree for the given characters along with their frequencies and print the Huffman codes. Make sure to adjust it according to your specific requirements and error handling.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Leaf Nodes in Trees

In C++, you can count the leaf nodes in a tree using various tree traversal techniques such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Here's an example using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Define the tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), children() {}
};

// Function to count leaf nodes using Depth First Search
int countLeafNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) // If the root is null, return 0
        return 0;
    if (root->children.empty()) // If the node has no children, it's a leaf node
        return 1;
    
    int leafCount = 0;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        leafCount += countLeafNodes(child); // Recursively count leaf nodes in each child
    }
    return leafCount;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(2));
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(6));

    // Counting the leaf nodes
    int leafCount = countLeafNodes(root);
    cout << "Number of leaf nodes: " << leafCount << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->children[0]->children[0];
    delete root->children[0]->children[1];
    delete root->children[1]->children[0];
    delete root->children[0];
    delete root->children[1];
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the tree. The `countLeafNodes` function takes the root of the tree as input and recursively counts the leaf nodes using Depth First Search. Finally, we create a sample tree in the `main` function, count the leaf nodes, and print the result.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Mango Trees

Mango trees are a delicious topic! When discussing algorithms and data structures related to mango trees, we can explore various aspects such as modeling the tree itself, managing the fruits (mangoes), and optimizing operations like harvesting or finding ripe mangoes efficiently.

Let's break it down into a few key areas:

1. **Modeling the Mango Tree**: You could represent a mango tree using data structures like trees or graphs. Each node could represent a part of the tree (trunk, branches, etc.), with child nodes representing smaller branches or fruit-bearing branches.

2. **Data Structures for Fruit Management**: Managing mangoes involves data structures to represent the fruits on the tree. This could be as simple as an array or a more complex structure like a priority queue to handle ripe mangoes first.

3. **Algorithms for Harvesting**: Harvesting ripe mangoes efficiently could involve algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the tree and pick ripe mangoes. Additionally, you might use techniques like pruning to optimize the harvesting process.

4. **Optimizing Growth and Yield**: To optimize mango tree growth and yield, algorithms can be used for tasks like determining the best time to prune branches, predicting fruit yield based on environmental factors, or even simulating different growth scenarios.

5. **Data Structures for Orchard Management**: If you're managing a whole orchard of mango trees, you might need data structures to represent the layout of the orchard, track tree health and fruit production, and optimize tasks like irrigation and fertilization.

In C++, you can implement these concepts using various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and queues, along with algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, sorting, and optimization algorithms.

Here's a simple conceptual example of how you might represent a mango tree and perform a basic operation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct MangoTreeNode {
    vector<MangoTreeNode*> children;
    bool ripe;

    MangoTreeNode(bool ripe = false) : ripe(ripe) {}
};

class MangoTree {
private:
    MangoTreeNode* root;

    void harvestRipeMangoes(MangoTreeNode* node) {
        if (node == nullptr)
            return;

        if (node->ripe) {
            cout << "Harvesting ripe mango!" << endl;
            node->ripe = false; // Assuming we pluck the mango
        }

        for (MangoTreeNode* child : node->children) {
            harvestRipeMangoes(child);
        }
    }

public:
    MangoTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function to harvest ripe mangoes
    void harvestRipeMangoes() {
        harvestRipeMangoes(root);
    }

    // Other functions for tree manipulation can be added here
};

int main() {
    // Creating a mango tree
    MangoTree mangoTree;

    // Adding nodes (branches) to the tree
    // Assuming some structure is built here...

    // Harvesting ripe mangoes
    mangoTree.harvestRipeMangoes();

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic example, but you can expand upon it to include more features and optimizations based on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max Subset Sum Tree

Creating a tree structure to find the maximum subset sum can be implemented using dynamic programming and recursion. Let's define a tree node structure and then write a C++ implementation for finding the maximum subset sum.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Tree Node Structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int v) : val(v) {}
};

// Function to find the maximum subset sum rooted at a particular node
int maxSubsetSum(TreeNode* root, unordered_map<TreeNode*, int>& dp) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    if (dp.find(root) != dp.end()) return dp[root]; // Memoization

    int takeNode = root->val;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        for (TreeNode* grandchild : child->children) {
            takeNode += maxSubsetSum(grandchild, dp);
        }
    }

    int skipNode = 0;
    for (TreeNode* child : root->children) {
        skipNode += maxSubsetSum(child, dp);
    }

    // Store the result for memoization
    dp[root] = max(takeNode, skipNode);
    return dp[root];
}

// Function to create a tree from an adjacency list
TreeNode* createTree(vector<vector<int>>& adjacencyList, int rootIdx) {
    unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> nodes;
    for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.size(); ++i) {
        nodes[i] = new TreeNode(i);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < adjacencyList.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j : adjacencyList[i]) {
            nodes[i]->children.push_back(nodes[j]);
        }
    }
    return nodes[rootIdx];
}

int main() {
    // Example Usage
    vector<vector<int>> adjacencyList = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {}, {}, {}};
    TreeNode* root = createTree(adjacencyList, 0);

    unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> dp;
    cout << "Maximum subset sum: " << maxSubsetSum(root, dp) << endl;

    // Clean up
    for (auto& pair : dp) {
        delete pair.first;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a TreeNode structure to represent each node in the tree. The `maxSubsetSum` function recursively calculates the maximum subset sum rooted at each node, using dynamic programming to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, the `createTree` function is used to construct the tree from an adjacency list representation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Max value in a Tree

Sure! Here's an example of how you can find the maximum value in a binary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int findMax(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        // If the tree is empty, return the smallest possible integer value
        // to indicate that there is no maximum value.
        return INT_MIN;
    }
    
    // Recursively find the maximum value in the left and right subtrees.
    int maxLeft = findMax(root->left);
    int maxRight = findMax(root->right);
    
    // Compare the maximum values in the left and right subtrees with the
    // value of the current node to find the overall maximum value.
    int maxNode = std::max(root->val, std::max(maxLeft, maxRight));
    
    return maxNode;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(15);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(18);

    // Find the maximum value in the tree
    int maxValue = findMax(root);
    std::cout << "The maximum value in the tree is: " << maxValue << std::endl;

    // Clean up allocated memory (not essential in this example, but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure `TreeNode` with an integer value and pointers to left and right children. The `findMax` function recursively traverses the binary tree to find the maximum value. The `main` function provides an example of how to use the `findMax` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Maximum White Subtree

The "Maximum White Subtree" problem is an interesting algorithmic problem often encountered in computer science. Here's an outline of how you might approach it in C++, assuming you have a tree data structure already defined.

The problem statement is usually something like this:

Given a binary tree where each node has a color (either white or black), find the maximum subtree such that all the nodes in that subtree are white.

Let's break down the solution into steps:

1. **Define the Tree Node Structure**: First, you need to define a structure for the nodes of the binary tree. Each node will contain data (perhaps a color) and pointers to its left and right children.

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    bool isWhite; // Assuming true for white, false for black
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
};
```

1. **Define the Function to Calculate Maximum White Subtree**: You'll need a recursive function to traverse the tree and find the maximum white subtree.

```cpp
pair<int, TreeNode*> maxWhiteSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) {
        return {0, nullptr};
    }

    auto left = maxWhiteSubtree(root->left);
    auto right = maxWhiteSubtree(root->right);

    int count = left.first + right.first + (root->isWhite ? 1 : 0);

    if (count == (left.first + right.first + 1)) {
        return {count, root};
    } else {
        return {max(left.first, right.first), left.first > right.first ? left.second : right.second};
    }
}
```

1. **Invoke the Function and Print the Result**: You can invoke the function passing the root of the tree and then print out the result.

```cpp
void printMaxWhiteSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
    auto result = maxWhiteSubtree(root);
    cout << "Maximum white subtree size: " << result.first << endl;
    cout << "Root of maximum white subtree: " << (result.second ? "Exists" : "Doesn't exist") << endl;
}
```

1. **Example Usage**: You can create a sample tree and invoke the function to see the result.

```cpp
int main() {
    // Create a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode{true, 
                                   new TreeNode{false, nullptr, nullptr}, 
                                   new TreeNode{true, nullptr, nullptr}};

    // Print the result
    printMaxWhiteSubtree(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic outline of how you might approach the "Maximum White Subtree" problem in C++. Depending on the exact requirements or constraints of your problem, you might need to adjust this solution accordingly.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

To perform a postorder traversal of an N-ary tree, you can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach using a stack. Here's a C++ implementation of both methods:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

// Recursive approach
void postorderRecursive(Node* root, vector<int>& result) {
    if (!root) return;

    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        postorderRecursive(child, result);
    }

    result.push_back(root->val);
}

vector<int> postorderRecursive(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    postorderRecursive(root, result);
    return result;
}

// Iterative approach using a stack
vector<int> postorderIterative(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (!root) return result;

    stack<Node*> s;
    s.push(root);

    while (!s.empty()) {
        Node* node = s.top();
        s.pop();
        result.insert(result.begin(), node->val);

        for (Node* child : node->children) {
            if (child) {
                s.push(child);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(6));

    cout << "Recursive Postorder Traversal: ";
    vector<int> recursiveResult = postorderRecursive(root);
    for (int val : recursiveResult) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Iterative Postorder Traversal: ";
    vector<int> iterativeResult = postorderIterative(root);
    for (int val : iterativeResult) {
        cout << val << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Node` class representing each node in the N-ary tree. Then, it provides two functions for performing postorder traversal: `postorderRecursive` and `postorderIterative`. Finally, it demonstrates the usage of both functions in the `main` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): N-ary Tree Preorder Treversal

Sure, here's how you can perform a preorder traversal on an N-ary tree using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node of an N-ary tree.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

void preorderTraversal(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Process the current node
    cout << root->val << " ";

    // Traverse all children recursively
    for (Node* child : root->children) {
        preorderTraversal(child);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->children.push_back(new Node(2));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(3));
    root->children.push_back(new Node(4));

    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(5));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new Node(6));

    preorderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Node` class representing a node in the N-ary tree. Each node has an integer value and a vector of child nodes.
- The `preorderTraversal` function performs a preorder traversal of the tree recursively. It first processes the current node, then recursively traverses each child node.
- In the `main` function, we create an example N-ary tree and call the `preorderTraversal` function to perform the traversal starting from the root node.

You can modify the `main` function to create different N-ary trees and test the preorder traversal algorithm.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): n-ary Trees

Certainly! N-ary trees are a type of tree data structure where each node can have a variable number of children, unlike binary trees where each node can have at most two children. Here's a basic overview of how you might implement an n-ary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for n-ary tree
template <typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value) {}
};

// N-ary tree class
template <typename T>
class NaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode<T>* root;

    // Helper function for recursive traversal
    void traverse(TreeNode<T>* node) {
        if (!node)
            return;
        cout << node->data << " ";
        for (TreeNode<T>* child : node->children) {
            traverse(child);
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    NaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Destructor
    ~NaryTree() {
        // Implement destructor to free allocated memory
    }

    // Insertion method
    void insert(const T& value, TreeNode<T>* parent) {
        TreeNode<T>* newNode = new TreeNode<T>(value);
        if (!root) {
            root = newNode;
        } else {
            parent->children.push_back(newNode);
        }
    }

    // Traversal method
    void traverse() {
        if (root) {
            traverse(root);
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    NaryTree<int> tree;

    // Insertion example
    TreeNode<int>* parent = nullptr;
    tree.insert(1, parent);  // Insert root node
    tree.insert(2, tree.root);  // Insert child nodes
    tree.insert(3, tree.root);
    tree.insert(4, tree.root->children[0]);  // Insert grandchild nodes

    // Traversal example
    tree.traverse();  // Output: 1 2 4 3

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- `TreeNode` is a template struct representing each node in the n-ary tree. It contains the node's data and a vector of pointers to its children.
- `NaryTree` is a template class representing the n-ary tree itself. It contains methods for insertion and traversal.
- The `insert` method inserts a new node with the given value as a child of the specified parent node.
- The `traverse` method performs a depth-first traversal of the tree, printing out the data of each node.

You can extend this implementation by adding more functionality such as deletion, searching, or balancing methods depending on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum

A path sum problem typically involves traversing through a tree data structure, such as a binary tree, and finding if there exists a path from the root to any leaf node whose sum equals a given target value. Here's a C++ implementation for a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    if (root == nullptr) return false;
    // If the current node is a leaf and its value is equal to the sum, then we've found the path
    if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr && root->val == sum) return true;
    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees with updated sum
    return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    /*
         5
        / \
       4   8
      /   / \
     11  13  4
    /  \      \
   7    2      1
    */
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);
    
    int targetSum = 22;
    
    if (hasPathSum(root, targetSum)) {
        cout << "There exists a root-to-leaf path with the sum of " << targetSum << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No such path exists with the sum of " << targetSum << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree. The `hasPathSum` function recursively checks if there exists a path from the current node to a leaf node with the given sum.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Sum - Trees

Sure, let's discuss the "Path Sum" problem for trees, a common question in algorithm interviews and a useful problem for practicing tree traversal techniques.

In the "Path Sum" problem, you're given a binary tree and a target sum. Your task is to determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Here's the general approach to solve this problem:

1. **Traverse the tree**: You can traverse the tree using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). In this case, DFS is more suitable because you need to explore all possible paths from the root to the leaves.

2. **Recursion**: Use a recursive function to traverse the tree. At each step, subtract the current node's value from the target sum and recursively check if the left or right subtree has a path sum equal to the remaining target sum.

3. **Base case**: The base case occurs when you reach a leaf node. Check if the remaining target sum equals the value of the leaf node. If it does, return true; otherwise, return false.

4. **Combine results**: If either the left or right subtree returns true, it means there's a path with the given sum in one of the subtrees. Return true in this case.

Here's a simple C++ implementation of this algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    // Base case: if the root is null, return false
    if (root == NULL)
        return false;

    // If the current node is a leaf and its value matches the sum, return true
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL && sum - root->val == 0)
        return true;

    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    // by subtracting the current node's value from the sum
    return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int targetSum = 22;
    if (hasPathSum(root, targetSum))
        cout << "Tree has a root-to-leaf path with sum " << targetSum << endl;
    else
        cout << "No such path found." << endl;

    // Don't forget to free the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we traverse the tree recursively, subtracting the value of each node from the target sum as we go. If we reach a leaf node and the remaining sum is 0, we return true indicating that a path with the given sum exists. Otherwise, we return false.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Path Xor

"Path XOR" typically refers to a problem where you're given a tree and tasked with finding the XOR of values along a path from one node to another. Here's a simple explanation and C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;
    Node(int v) : val(v) {}
};

unordered_map<Node*, int> xorValues; // Stores XOR values for each node

// DFS to calculate XOR values for each node
void calculateXOR(Node* node, int parentXOR) {
    xorValues[node] = parentXOR ^ node->val; // XOR value for current node
    for (Node* child : node->children) {
        calculateXOR(child, xorValues[node]); // Recursively calculate for children
    }
}

// Function to find XOR of values on the path between two nodes
int pathXOR(Node* node1, Node* node2) {
    int xorResult = xorValues[node1] ^ xorValues[node2]; // XOR of values from root to LCA (Least Common Ancestor)
    return xorResult;
}

int main() {
    // Example tree creation
    Node* root = new Node(0);
    Node* child1 = new Node(1);
    Node* child2 = new Node(0);
    Node* child3 = new Node(1);
    Node* child4 = new Node(0);

    root->children = {child1, child2};
    child1->children = {child3, child4};

    calculateXOR(root, 0); // Calculate XOR values

    // Example queries
    Node* nodeA = root; // Example node A
    Node* nodeB = child1; // Example node B
    cout << "XOR of values on path between node A and node B: " << pathXOR(nodeA, nodeB) << endl;

    // Remember to free allocated memory
    delete root;
    delete child1;
    delete child2;
    delete child3;
    delete child4;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a tree structure and provides functions to calculate the XOR values along paths and find the XOR value between two nodes. The `calculateXOR` function performs a depth-first traversal to compute the XOR values for each node. Then, the `pathXOR` function calculates the XOR value along the path between two given nodes using their computed XOR values.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Paths with Sums

To implement a solution for finding paths with sums in C++, you can use a tree data structure, like a binary tree, and traverse it while keeping track of the running sum. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int countPathsWithSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int currentSum, unordered_map<int, int>& prefixSumMap) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;

    // Update the current sum with the value of the current node
    currentSum += root->val;

    // Calculate the number of paths ending at the current node with the target sum
    int pathsWithSum = prefixSumMap[currentSum - targetSum];

    // If the current sum equals the target sum, increment the count
    if (currentSum == targetSum)
        pathsWithSum++;

    // Update the prefix sum map
    prefixSumMap[currentSum]++;

    // Recursively traverse the left and right subtrees
    pathsWithSum += countPathsWithSum(root->left, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumMap);
    pathsWithSum += countPathsWithSum(root->right, targetSum, currentSum, prefixSumMap);

    // Restore the prefix sum map to its previous state before returning
    prefixSumMap[currentSum]--;

    return pathsWithSum;
}

int countPathsWithSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
    unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumMap;
    prefixSumMap[0] = 1; // Account for paths starting from the root
    return countPathsWithSum(root, targetSum, 0, prefixSumMap);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right = new TreeNode(-3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(11);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(-2);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(1);

    int targetSum = 8;
    cout << "Number of paths with sum " << targetSum << ": " << countPathsWithSum(root, targetSum) << endl;

    // Remember to free the memory allocated for the tree nodes
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree node structure and a function `countPathsWithSum` to count the number of paths in the tree that sum up to a given target sum. It uses a prefix sum map to efficiently track the running sum of paths encountered so far.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Performance Analysis of Splay Trees

Splay Tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree where every operation on the tree causes a restructuring, called "splaying," that brings the most recently accessed item to the root. This makes recently accessed items quicker to access in future operations.

#### Key Operations

1. **Insertion**: Insert a new element into the tree.
2. **Deletion**: Remove an element from the tree.
3. **Search**: Find an element in the tree.
4. **Splaying**: Reorganize the tree to bring the most recently accessed element to the root.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the operations in a splay tree varies depending on the tree's shape after each operation. In the average case, the amortized time complexity of splay tree operations is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the tree. However, in the worst case, the time complexity can be O(n), such as when the tree becomes degenerate (essentially a linked list).

#### Performance Analysis

1. **Amortized Performance**: Splay trees offer good amortized performance. Despite potential worst-case scenarios, the splay operation balances the tree during operations, leading to efficient average performance over many operations.

2. **Worst-case Scenarios**: Although splay trees provide amortized O(log n) performance, individual operations can occasionally degrade to O(n) in the worst-case scenario. This worst-case behavior typically occurs with sequences of operations that consistently access the tree in a specific pattern, leading to tree imbalance.

3. **Self-Adjusting Behavior**: Splay trees have the advantage of adaptively adjusting their structure based on access patterns. This means that frequently accessed elements move closer to the root, improving future access times for those elements.

4. **Cache Performance**: Splay trees may exhibit poorer cache performance compared to other balanced search trees like AVL or Red-Black trees because of their dynamic restructuring, which can lead to more unpredictable memory access patterns.

5. **Space Complexity**: Splay trees have similar space complexity to other binary search trees, requiring O(n) space for n elements.

#### Conclusion

Splay trees are efficient for many practical scenarios due to their self-adjusting behavior and amortized O(log n) performance. However, their performance can degrade in specific worst-case scenarios. They are particularly useful when there is locality in the access patterns, as frequently accessed elements move closer to the root, improving overall performance. Nonetheless, in critical applications where worst-case performance is a concern, other balanced search trees may be preferred.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Practical (real-world) applications of trees

Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science and are used in various practical applications. Here are some real-world applications of trees:

1. **File System**: File systems in operating systems often use tree data structures to organize files and directories. Each directory can contain multiple files or subdirectories, forming a hierarchical structure.

2. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: BSTs are widely used in database systems and libraries for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They are also utilized in implementing associative arrays and symbol tables.

3. **Binary Heap**: Binary heaps, a specialized form of binary trees, are used in priority queues and scheduling algorithms. They efficiently support operations like insertion, deletion, and finding the minimum (or maximum) element.

4. **Syntax Tree**: In compilers and interpreters, syntax trees, also known as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), are constructed to represent the structure of source code. They are utilized in parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation phases.

5. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Tries are used in applications where efficient retrieval of a set of strings with a common prefix is required, such as autocomplete systems in search engines and text editors.

6. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**: BIT, also known as Fenwick tree, is used in algorithms that require efficient prefix sum computations, such as range queries and updating elements in an array.

7. **Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees**: These self-balancing binary search trees are commonly used in implementing associative containers like sets and maps. They ensure logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

8. **XML/HTML Parsing**: Trees are used to represent the hierarchical structure of XML and HTML documents. DOM (Document Object Model) parsers construct a tree-like structure to represent the elements and their relationships in these documents.

9. **Hierarchical Data Representation**: Trees are used to represent hierarchical data structures like organization charts, family trees, and menus in graphical user interfaces.

10. **Game Development**: Trees are used in various aspects of game development, such as scene graphs for representing game scenes, behavior trees for defining AI behaviors, and decision trees for game logic and dialogue systems.

These are just a few examples of how trees are applied in real-world scenarios. Trees provide efficient solutions for organizing, searching, and manipulating hierarchical data structures in diverse domains.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Pre-order Traversal Technique

Pre-order traversal is one of the fundamental techniques used in tree-based data structures. It's particularly common in binary trees and can be implemented recursively or iteratively. Here's how you can implement it in C++ using a recursive approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a binary tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform pre-order traversal recursively
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Process the current node
    std::cout << root->data << " ";

    // Recursively traverse the left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);

    // Recursively traverse the right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform pre-order traversal
    std::cout << "Pre-order Traversal: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct to represent the nodes of the binary tree.
- The `preOrderTraversal` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and recursively traverses the tree in pre-order fashion.
- In the `main` function, we create a binary tree and call `preOrderTraversal` to perform the traversal.

This code will output:

```bash
Pre-order Traversal: 1 2 4 5 3 6 7
```

This output reflects the nodes visited in the order of pre-order traversal.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): PrintTree

Certainly! Here's a simple implementation in C++ to print a binary tree using inorder traversal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void printInorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    // Traverse the left subtree
    printInorder(root->left);
    // Print the current node's value
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    // Traverse the right subtree
    printInorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary tree: ";
    printInorder(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a binary tree structure and a function `printInorder` to print the tree using inorder traversal. You can modify the `TreeNode` structure and the `printInorder` function according to your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Representation of Trees

In C++, trees can be represented using various data structures. Here are a few common representations:

1. **Node-based Representation (using classes/structs):**
   You can define a `TreeNode` class/struct representing each node in the tree. Each node contains data and pointers to its children (usually left and right child in a binary tree).

    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int data;
        TreeNode* left;
        TreeNode* right;
        TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    };
    ```

2. **Array-based Representation:**
   For binary trees, you can use an array to represent the tree, where each node at index `i` has its children at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child).

    ```cpp
    vector<int> tree; // Assuming you have declared a vector to store the tree nodes
    ```

3. **Adjacency List Representation:**
   For general trees, you can use an adjacency list where each node stores a list of its children.

    ```cpp
    vector<vector<int>> tree; // Assuming you have declared a 2D vector to store the adjacency list
    ```

4. **Parent Pointer Representation:**
   Each node contains a pointer to its parent node, along with any other necessary information.

    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int data;
        TreeNode* parent;
        // Additional properties as needed
    };
    ```

5. **Specialized Representation:**
   Depending on the type of tree and its application, you may choose specialized representations. For example, for a binary search tree, you may have additional properties like balancing factors (for AVL or Red-Black trees).

Choose the representation based on the specific requirements and operations you need to perform on the tree. Each representation has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of memory usage, traversal efficiency, and ease of implementation for different operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Same Tree

In C++, determining if two binary trees are the same involves comparing their structures and values. You can do this recursively by traversing both trees simultaneously. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // If both trees are empty, they are the same
        if (!p && !q) return true;
        // If one tree is empty and the other is not, they are not the same
        if (!p || !q) return false;
        // If the values of the current nodes are not equal, they are not the same
        if (p->val != q->val) return false;
        // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
        return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* p = new TreeNode(1);
    p->left = new TreeNode(2);
    p->right = new TreeNode(3);

    TreeNode* q = new TreeNode(1);
    q->left = new TreeNode(2);
    q->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isSameTree(p, q)) {
        std::cout << "The trees are the same." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The trees are not the same." << std::endl;
    }

    // Free memory
    delete p->left;
    delete p->right;
    delete p;
    delete q->left;
    delete q->right;
    delete q;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct representing a node in the binary tree.
- The `isSameTree` function recursively checks if two trees are the same. It returns `true` if both trees are empty, or if their root nodes have the same value and their left and right subtrees are the same.
- In the `main` function, we create two example binary trees `p` and `q`, and then we use the `isSameTree` function to check if they are the same. Finally, we free the dynamically allocated memory.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Search Trees

Search trees are fundamental data structures used in computer science to organize and efficiently retrieve data. In C++, the most common search trees include binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. Let's briefly discuss each of them:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
   - In a binary search tree, each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
   - The key property of a BST is that for each node, all elements in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all elements in its right subtree are greater than the node's value.
   - Searching, insertion, and deletion operations in BSTs have an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees, but can degrade to O(n) in the worst case if the tree becomes unbalanced.

2. **AVL Tree**:
   - An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node (known as the balance factor) is at most 1.
   - AVL trees maintain their balance through rotations (single and double rotations) during insertions and deletions.
   - The advantage of AVL trees over basic BSTs is that they guarantee O(log n) time complexity for all basic operations.

3. **Red-Black Tree**:
   - Red-black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
   - They ensure that the tree remains balanced by enforcing five properties:
     1. Every node is either red or black.
     2. The root is black.
     3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
     4. Red nodes cannot have red children.
     5. Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes must have the same number of black nodes.
   - Like AVL trees, red-black trees guarantee O(log n) time complexity for all basic operations.

4. **B-Tree**:
   - B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disk or other direct-access secondary storage devices.
   - They are characterized by a variable number of keys and children per node, typically denoted as B.
   - B-trees are widely used in databases and file systems because they minimize the number of disk accesses required to perform insertions, deletions, and searches.
   - Basic operations on B-trees have a time complexity of O(log n).

In C++, you can implement these search trees using classes and structs. Libraries like the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) provide implementations for some of these data structures, such as `std::set` (implemented as a red-black tree) and `std::map` (implemented as a red-black tree or AVL tree depending on the implementation).

When implementing these data structures, consider not just the basic operations but also balancing mechanisms and edge cases to ensure optimal performance and correctness.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Segment Trees

Segment trees are a powerful data structure used mainly in the realm of competitive programming and algorithms where efficient querying and updating of segments of an array are required. They are particularly useful for range query problems, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or other associative operation over a range of elements in an array.

Here's a basic overview of how segment trees work:

1. **Construction**:
   - The segment tree is typically represented as a binary tree. Each node of the tree represents a segment or interval of the array.
   - The root of the tree represents the entire array, and each leaf node represents a single element of the array.
   - Each internal node of the tree represents the union of the intervals covered by its two children.

2. **Segment Tree Node**:
   - Each node of the segment tree contains information about the segment it represents. This information depends on the specific problem being solved. For example, in case of range sum queries, each node may store the sum of the elements in its corresponding segment.

3. **Querying**:
   - To answer a query over a given range [L, R], we traverse the segment tree starting from the root.
   - At each internal node, we check if its corresponding segment completely lies inside, completely outside, or partially overlaps with the query range.
   - If the segment lies completely outside the query range, we skip it.
   - If the segment lies completely inside the query range, we return the information stored at that node.
   - If the segment partially overlaps with the query range, we recursively search both of its children.

4. **Updating**:
   - To update the value of an element at a specific index, we start from the root and traverse down the tree until we reach the leaf node corresponding to the index.
   - We update the value at the leaf node and propagate the changes upwards to update the values of ancestor nodes as needed.

In C++, you can implement a segment tree using an array representation or a tree-based representation (using pointers or a vector). The array representation is more memory-efficient and faster, while the tree-based representation might be easier to understand and code.

Here's a simple example of a segment tree for range sum queries implemented in C++ using the array representation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> segment_tree;

void build_segment_tree(const vector<int>& arr, int node, int start, int end) {
    if (start == end) {
        segment_tree[node] = arr[start];
    } else {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        build_segment_tree(arr, 2 * node + 1, start, mid);
        build_segment_tree(arr, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end);
        segment_tree[node] = segment_tree[2 * node + 1] + segment_tree[2 * node + 2];
    }
}

int query_segment_tree(int node, int start, int end, int l, int r) {
    if (r < start || end < l) return 0; // Completely outside the query range
    if (l <= start && end <= r) return segment_tree[node]; // Completely inside the query range

    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    int sum_left = query_segment_tree(2 * node + 1, start, mid, l, r);
    int sum_right = query_segment_tree(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, l, r);
    return sum_left + sum_right;
}

void update_segment_tree(int node, int start, int end, int index, int new_value) {
    if (start == end) {
        segment_tree[node] = new_value;
    } else {
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        if (index <= mid) {
            update_segment_tree(2 * node + 1, start, mid, index, new_value);
        } else {
            update_segment_tree(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, index, new_value);
        }
        segment_tree[node] = segment_tree[2 * node + 1] + segment_tree[2 * node + 2];
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};
    int n = arr.size();

    // Build segment tree
    segment_tree.resize(4 * n);
    build_segment_tree(arr, 0, 0, n - 1);

    // Query example
    int sum = query_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 1, 3);
    cout << "Sum of elements in range [1, 3]: " << sum << endl;

    // Update example
    update_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 2, 10);
    sum = query_segment_tree(0, 0, n - 1, 1, 3);
    cout << "Sum of elements in range [1, 3] after update: " << sum << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic implementation; there are more advanced techniques like lazy propagation to optimize updates, and other types of segment trees (such as segment trees for range minimum/maximum queries).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Shortest Tree Path

To find the shortest path in a tree, you can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's a C++ implementation of BFS to find the shortest path in a tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to add an edge between two nodes
void addEdge(TreeNode* u, TreeNode* v) {
    u->children.push_back(v);
    v->children.push_back(u); // For undirected tree
}

// Function to perform BFS to find the shortest path
int shortestPath(TreeNode* root, int target) {
    if (root == nullptr) return -1; // If the tree is empty

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int level = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* curr = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (curr->val == target)
                return level; // Return the shortest path length
            for (TreeNode* child : curr->children)
                q.push(child);
        }
        level++; // Increment level for each level traversed
    }

    // If the target is not found in the tree
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    // Constructing a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    TreeNode* node2 = new TreeNode(2);
    TreeNode* node3 = new TreeNode(3);
    TreeNode* node4 = new TreeNode(4);
    TreeNode* node5 = new TreeNode(5);
    TreeNode* node6 = new TreeNode(6);

    addEdge(root, node2);
    addEdge(root, node3);
    addEdge(node2, node4);
    addEdge(node2, node5);
    addEdge(node3, node6);

    int target = 6; // Target node to find shortest path to
    int shortest = shortestPath(root, target);
    if (shortest != -1)
        cout << "Shortest path to " << target << " is " << shortest << endl;
    else
        cout << "Target node not found in the tree!" << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` structure representing each node in the tree. The `addEdge` function connects two nodes by adding each other to their respective `children` vectors. The `shortestPath` function performs BFS to find the shortest path from the root to the target node. Finally, the `main` function constructs a sample tree, specifies a target node, and prints the shortest path length.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Spanning Tree

A spanning tree is a fundamental concept in graph theory, and it plays a crucial role in various algorithms, especially in network design, routing, and optimization. In the context of a graph, a spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree (a connected acyclic graph) and includes all the vertices of the original graph. Here's how you can implement a spanning tree in C++ using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Graph class representing the graph and its vertices
class Graph {
    int V; // Number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adj; // Adjacency list

public:
    Graph(int V) : V(V) {
        adj.resize(V);
    }

    // Add an edge to the graph
    void addEdge(int u, int v) {
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        adj[v].push_back(u); // For undirected graph
    }

    // Utility function to perform DFS recursively
    void DFSUtil(int v, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[v] = true;
        cout << v << " ";

        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u]) {
                DFSUtil(u, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    // Function to print the spanning tree using DFS
    void printSpanningTree(int startVertex) {
        vector<bool> visited(V, false);
        DFSUtil(startVertex, visited);
    }
};

int main() {
    int V = 6; // Number of vertices
    Graph g(V);

    // Add edges to the graph
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 3);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 4);
    g.addEdge(3, 5);

    cout << "Spanning tree using DFS starting from vertex 0: ";
    g.printSpanningTree(0);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `Graph` class to represent the graph and its vertices using an adjacency list.
- The `addEdge` function is used to add edges to the graph.
- The `DFSUtil` function performs Depth-First Search recursively starting from a given vertex.
- The `printSpanningTree` function prints the spanning tree using DFS starting from a specified vertex.
- In the `main` function, we create a graph and add edges to it. Then, we print the spanning tree starting from vertex 0.

This is a simple example of finding a spanning tree using DFS. There are other algorithms like Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm that also find spanning trees, each with its own advantages and use cases.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Subtree Checker

Sure, a subtree checker is a common problem in computer science and is often encountered in tree data structures. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Utility function to check if two trees are identical
bool areIdentical(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr && t == nullptr)
        return true;

    if (s == nullptr || t == nullptr)
        return false;

    return (s->val == t->val) &&
           areIdentical(s->left, t->left) &&
           areIdentical(s->right, t->right);
}

// Function to check if tree t is a subtree of tree s
bool isSubtree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr)
        return false;

    if (areIdentical(s, t))
        return true;

    return isSubtree(s->left, t) || isSubtree(s->right, t);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* s = new TreeNode(3);
    s->left = new TreeNode(4);
    s->right = new TreeNode(5);
    s->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    s->left->right = new TreeNode(2);

    TreeNode* t = new TreeNode(4);
    t->left = new TreeNode(1);
    t->right = new TreeNode(2);

    if (isSubtree(s, t))
        cout << "Tree t is a subtree of tree s." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Tree t is not a subtree of tree s." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in a binary tree.
- The `areIdentical` function checks whether two trees are identical by traversing them recursively.
- The `isSubtree` function checks whether tree `t` is a subtree of tree `s`. It does so by checking if `t` is identical to any subtree of `s` using the `areIdentical` function recursively.
- In the `main` function, an example usage is demonstrated by creating two binary trees `s` and `t`, and then checking whether `t` is a subtree of `s`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Subtree Problem

The subtree problem is a common problem in computer science and data structures. Given two trees, we're tasked with determining if one tree is a subtree of another.

Here's a basic approach to solve this problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Utility function to check if two trees are identical
bool areIdentical(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr && t == nullptr)
        return true;
    if (s == nullptr || t == nullptr)
        return false;
    return (s->val == t->val) && areIdentical(s->left, t->left) && areIdentical(s->right, t->right);
}

// Main function to check if 't' is a subtree of 's'
bool isSubtree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
    if (s == nullptr)
        return false;
    if (areIdentical(s, t))
        return true;
    return isSubtree(s->left, t) || isSubtree(s->right, t);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* s = new TreeNode(3);
    s->left = new TreeNode(4);
    s->right = new TreeNode(5);
    s->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    s->left->right = new TreeNode(2);

    TreeNode* t = new TreeNode(4);
    t->left = new TreeNode(1);
    t->right = new TreeNode(2);

    if (isSubtree(s, t))
        std::cout << "Tree t is a subtree of tree s.\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Tree t is not a subtree of tree s.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree, containing an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.
- The `areIdentical` function checks if two trees are identical by recursively comparing their structures and values.
- The `isSubtree` function recursively checks if `t` is a subtree of `s` by first checking if they are identical, and then recursively checking in the left and right subtrees of `s`.
- In the `main` function, we create two trees `s` and `t`, and then check if `t` is a subtree of `s`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m and n are the number of nodes in the two trees, respectively. There are more optimized approaches, like serializing the trees into strings and using KMP algorithm, or using hashmaps for faster subtree matching.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Sum of Nodes in Trees

Sure! Calculating the sum of nodes in a tree is a common operation in computer science and can be implemented using various algorithms. Here's a simple example of how you could implement this in C++ using a basic binary tree structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Define the structure of a tree node
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to calculate the sum of all nodes in the tree
int sumOfNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) // Base case: if the tree is empty
        return 0;
    
    // Perform a level order traversal using a queue
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int sum = 0;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // Add the value of the current node to the sum
        sum += current->val;
        
        // Add left and right children to the queue if they exist
        if (current->left)
            q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
    
    return sum;
}

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Calculate the sum of all nodes in the tree
    int totalSum = sumOfNodes(root);
    cout << "Sum of nodes in the tree: " << totalSum << endl;

    // Clean up memory
    // (Not necessary for the example, but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a binary tree with integer values and calculates the sum of all nodes using a level-order traversal (breadth-first search) algorithm. The `sumOfNodes` function takes the root of the tree as input and returns the sum of all node values. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function by creating a sample binary tree and printing the sum of its nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Symmetric Tree

Creating a symmetric tree in C++ involves ensuring that for every node in the tree, its left subtree is a mirror image of its right subtree. Here's a simple implementation of a symmetric tree check using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true; // An empty tree is symmetric

        return isMirror(root->left, root->right);
    }

private:
    bool isMirror(TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) {
        // If both subtrees are empty, they are mirrors
        if (!left && !right) return true;
        // If one subtree is empty but not the other, they are not mirrors
        if (!left || !right) return false;
        // If the values of the current nodes are not equal, they are not mirrors
        if (left->val != right->val) return false;

        // Recursively check if the subtrees are mirrors
        return isMirror(left->left, right->right) && isMirror(left->right, right->left);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(3);

    Solution solution;
    if (solution.isSymmetric(root))
        std::cout << "The tree is symmetric.\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The tree is not symmetric.\n";

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and a `Solution` class. The `isSymmetric` function checks if the tree is symmetric by calling the `isMirror` function which recursively compares corresponding nodes in the left and right subtrees. If the values match and their respective children subtrees are also mirrors, the tree is symmetric.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree 2 Linked List

In C++, converting a binary tree to a doubly linked list involves traversing the tree in a specific order and linking the nodes accordingly. Here's a general outline of how you can achieve this using the in-order traversal technique:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Definition for doubly-linked list node.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* prev;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* treeToLinkedList(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return nullptr;

        // Initialize the head of the linked list
        ListNode* head = nullptr;
        // Tail pointer to keep track of the last node of the linked list
        ListNode* tail = nullptr;
        
        convert(root, head, tail);

        return head;
    }

private:
    void convert(TreeNode* root, ListNode*& head, ListNode*& tail) {
        if (root == nullptr)
            return;
        
        // In-order traversal
        convert(root->left, head, tail);

        // Process current node
        ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(root->val);
        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            tail->next = newNode;
            newNode->prev = tail;
        }
        tail = newNode;

        convert(root->right, head, tail);
    }
};

// Utility function to print the linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        cout << head->val << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    Solution solution;
    ListNode* head = solution.treeToLinkedList(root);

    cout << "Linked List: ";
    printList(head);

    // Free allocated memory
    while (head != nullptr) {
        ListNode* temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree and converts it to a doubly linked list. The `convert()` function recursively traverses the tree, and for each node, it creates a new linked list node and links it to the previous node (if any) and updates the tail pointer to the newly created node. Finally, it returns the head of the resulting linked list.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree breadth first search

In C++, implementing breadth-first search (BFS) on a tree typically involves using a queue data structure to traverse the tree level by level. Here's how you can implement BFS on a tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void BFS(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    // Create a queue for BFS
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        // Get the front node in the queue
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Process the current node
        cout << current->val << " ";

        // Enqueue the left child
        if (current->left != nullptr) {
            q.push(current->left);
        }

        // Enqueue the right child
        if (current->right != nullptr) {
            q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Perform BFS on the tree
    cout << "Breadth-First Traversal: ";
    BFS(root);
    cout << endl;

    // Clean up
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `BFS` function performs breadth-first traversal on the tree using a queue. It starts from the root, enqueues each node's children (if they exist), and then dequeues the next node to process.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample binary tree and call the `BFS` function to traverse it.

This implementation prints the nodes of the tree in BFS order. You can modify it as needed to suit your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree breadth first search: Complexity analysis

The complexity analysis of breadth-first search (BFS) on a tree in terms of time and space can be broken down as follows:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - BFS traverses all the nodes in the tree level by level, visiting each node once.
   - In the worst case, every node and edge will be visited exactly once.
   - The time complexity of BFS on a tree is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.
   - In a tree, the number of edges is typically V - 1 (each node except the root has exactly one incoming edge).
   - So, the time complexity simplifies to O(V).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - BFS typically requires additional space for the queue data structure used for traversal.
   - At any point during the traversal, the queue may contain at most all the nodes of the current level.
   - The maximum number of nodes that can be in the queue at any time is the maximum number of nodes at any level.
   - In a tree, the maximum number of nodes at any level is the maximum number of nodes at any depth, which is typically the number of nodes in the last level.
   - Therefore, the space complexity of BFS on a tree is O(W), where W is the maximum number of nodes at any level (the width of the tree).

In summary:

- Time Complexity: O(V)
- Space Complexity: O(W)

In a balanced binary tree, the maximum width (W) is at most 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Hence, for a balanced binary tree, the space complexity of BFS would be O(2^(h-1)), which simplifies to O(2^h). However, in the case of a skewed tree, the width can be equal to the number of nodes in the last level, resulting in a space complexity of O(V) (as W ≤ V).

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree depth first search

Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. In the context of trees, DFS starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Here's a simple implementation of DFS for a binary tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

// Node structure for binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform depth-first search on a binary tree
void dfs(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    stack<TreeNode*> nodeStack;
    nodeStack.push(root);

    while (!nodeStack.empty()) {
        TreeNode* currNode = nodeStack.top();
        nodeStack.pop();
        cout << currNode->data << " ";

        // Push right child first so that it's processed after the left child (due to LIFO nature of stack)
        if (currNode->right) nodeStack.push(currNode->right);
        if (currNode->left) nodeStack.push(currNode->left);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Depth-First Search (DFS): ";
    dfs(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a depth-first search traversal of a binary tree using an iterative approach with a stack. It prints the elements of the tree in DFS order. Remember, DFS can be implemented recursively as well, but iterative implementations are often preferred for large trees or graphs to avoid stack overflow due to excessive recursion.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree depth first search: Complexity analysis

Depth-first search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. When applied to trees, DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

The complexity analysis of DFS on a tree mainly depends on the structure of the tree and the implementation of DFS.

Let's break down the complexity analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - In a tree traversal, each node is visited exactly once.
   - If the tree has \( n \) nodes, the time complexity of DFS is \( O(n) \).
   - This is because each node is visited once, and the time taken to process each node is constant.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - In DFS, a stack (either explicit or implicit through recursive function calls) is used to keep track of nodes to be visited.
   - The maximum depth of the recursion stack corresponds to the height of the tree.
   - For a balanced binary tree, the height is \( O(\log n) \). Therefore, the space complexity of DFS is \( O(\log n) \) for a balanced binary tree.
   - However, for a skewed tree (where each node has only one child), the height of the tree becomes \( O(n) \), leading to a space complexity of \( O(n) \).

3. **Auxiliary Space Complexity**:
   - Apart from the recursion stack, DFS may also require additional space for other data structures used in the algorithm, such as a visited set or an explicit stack.
   - The space required for these data structures is also \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

In summary, the time complexity of DFS on a tree is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes, and the space complexity can vary depending on the structure of the tree: \( O(\log n) \) for balanced trees and \( O(n) \) for skewed trees. Additionally, the auxiliary space complexity is also \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter

Finding the diameter of a tree is a common problem in the realm of algorithms and data structures. The diameter of a tree is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. Here's a C++ implementation of finding the diameter of a tree using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

// Tree node structure
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x) {}
};

// Function to perform DFS and find the farthest node
pair<int, int> dfs(TreeNode* node) {
    if (!node) return make_pair(0, -1);
    
    int max_depth = 0;
    int farthest_node = node->val;

    for (TreeNode* child : node->children) {
        pair<int, int> result = dfs(child);
        if (result.first + 1 > max_depth) {
            max_depth = result.first + 1;
            farthest_node = result.second;
        }
    }

    return make_pair(max_depth, farthest_node);
}

// Function to find the diameter of the tree
int treeDiameter(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    // Finding the farthest node from the root
    pair<int, int> p1 = dfs(root);

    // Finding the farthest node from the farthest node
    pair<int, int> p2 = dfs(new TreeNode(p1.second));

    return p2.first;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(2));
    root->children.push_back(new TreeNode(3));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(4));
    root->children[0]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(5));
    root->children[1]->children.push_back(new TreeNode(6));

    cout << "Diameter of the tree: " << treeDiameter(root) << endl;

    // Remember to free the allocated memory
    // (Not necessary for this example, but for general case)
    return 0;
}
```

This code first defines a tree node structure and then implements DFS to find the farthest node from the root. Then, it finds the farthest node from that farthest node, which gives the diameter of the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter Concept

In the context of algorithms and data structures, the diameter of a tree is a fundamental concept that represents the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. It's a crucial metric in understanding the overall structure and efficiency of operations on trees.

Here's how you can understand and calculate the diameter of a tree:

1. **Understanding the Tree Diameter**:
   - In a tree, the diameter is the longest path between any two nodes. This path does not necessarily have to pass through the root node.
   - The diameter of a tree can be defined as the maximum of:
     - The diameter of the left subtree.
     - The diameter of the right subtree.
     - The longest path between two nodes that passes through the root.

2. **Calculating Tree Diameter**:
   - One way to calculate the diameter of a tree is by using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm.
   - Start DFS from any arbitrary node in the tree.
   - Find the farthest node from the starting node using DFS.
   - Then, from that farthest node, run another DFS to find the farthest node from it.
   - The distance between these two farthest nodes is the diameter of the tree.

3. **Pseudocode**:

   ```
   Function diameter(tree, node):
       If tree is empty or node is null:
           return 0
       max_left_subtree = diameter(tree.left, node)
       max_right_subtree = diameter(tree.right, node)
       diameter = max(max_left_subtree, max_right_subtree, height(tree.left) + height(tree.right) + 1)
       return diameter

   Function height(tree):
       If tree is empty:
           return 0
       return 1 + max(height(tree.left), height(tree.right))
   ```

4. **Implementation in C++**:

   ```cpp
   struct TreeNode {
       int val;
       TreeNode *left;
       TreeNode *right;
       TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
   };

   int height(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr)
           return 0;
       return 1 + max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
   }

   int diameter(TreeNode* root) {
       if (root == nullptr)
           return 0;
       int leftHeight = height(root->left);
       int rightHeight = height(root->right);

       int leftDiameter = diameter(root->left);
       int rightDiameter = diameter(root->right);

       return max({leftDiameter, rightDiameter, leftHeight + rightHeight + 1});
   }
   ```

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - This is because for each node, we calculate the height of its left and right subtrees, leading to a potentially quadratic time complexity.
  
6. **Optimization**:
   - The above approach can be optimized using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid recalculating heights of subtrees.

Understanding the diameter of a tree is essential in various applications, including network routing algorithms, optimization problems, and computer graphics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Diameter Optimised

Optimizing the calculation of the diameter of a tree, which is the longest path between any two nodes, typically involves performing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) from a chosen starting node. Here's an optimized C++ implementation using DFS:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a node in the tree
struct Node {
    int id;
    vector<pair<int, int>> adj; // Adjacency list representation of edges (connected node ID, edge weight)
};

// Function to perform DFS to find the farthest node and its distance
pair<int, int> dfs(const vector<Node>& tree, int node, int parent) {
    pair<int, int> farthest = {node, 0}; // Initialize the farthest node and its distance
    for (const auto& edge : tree[node].adj) {
        int child = edge.first;
        int weight = edge.second;
        if (child != parent) { // Avoid going back to parent
            auto childResult = dfs(tree, child, node);
            if (childResult.second + weight > farthest.second) {
                farthest = {childResult.first, childResult.second + weight};
            }
        }
    }
    return farthest;
}

// Function to find the diameter of the tree
int treeDiameter(const vector<Node>& tree) {
    // Start DFS from any node (here, we choose node 0)
    pair<int, int> farthestFromRoot = dfs(tree, 0, -1);
    // Perform DFS from the farthest node to find the actual diameter
    pair<int, int> farthestFromFarthest = dfs(tree, farthestFromRoot.first, -1);
    return farthestFromFarthest.second;
}

int main() {
    int n; // Number of nodes
    cin >> n;

    vector<Node> tree(n);

    // Input the edges and their weights
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w; // Edge from u to v with weight w
        tree[u].adj.push_back({v, w});
        tree[v].adj.push_back({u, w});
    }

    int diameter = treeDiameter(tree);
    cout << "Diameter of the tree: " << diameter << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation avoids recomputation by only traversing the tree twice: once to find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting point, and then from that farthest node to another farthest node to determine the diameter. This ensures optimal time complexity for tree diameter computation.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Distances

To calculate the distances between nodes in a tree, you can use a technique called dynamic programming. Here's a C++ implementation using Depth First Search (DFS) to calculate the distance between every pair of nodes in the tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MAXN = 100005; // Maximum number of nodes
vector<int> tree[MAXN]; // Adjacency list to represent the tree
int dist[MAXN][MAXN]; // Array to store distances between nodes

// Function to perform DFS to calculate distances
void dfs(int node, int parent, int root) {
    dist[root][node] = dist[root][parent] + 1; // Update distance from the root to the current node

    for (int child : tree[node]) {
        if (child != parent) {
            dfs(child, node, root); // Recur for child nodes
        }
    }
}

// Function to initialize distances for each node
void initDistances(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dist[i][i] = 0; // Distance from a node to itself is 0
        dfs(i, 0, i); // Calculate distances from node i to all other nodes
    }
}

int main() {
    int n; // Number of nodes
    cin >> n;

    // Input the tree edges
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int u, v; // Edge between node u and node v
        cin >> u >> v;
        tree[u].push_back(v);
        tree[v].push_back(u); // Since the tree is undirected
    }

    // Initialize distances
    initDistances(n);

    // Output distances between all pairs of nodes
    cout << "Distances between all pairs of nodes:\n";
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            cout << dist[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree.
- `dfs` function recursively calculates the distance between the current node and the root of the tree.
- `initDistances` initializes the `dist` array by calling `dfs` for each node as the root.
- The main function takes input for the tree edges, initializes distances, and then outputs the distances between all pairs of nodes.

This algorithm runs in O(N^2) time complexity, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree Traversal

Tree traversal is a fundamental operation in computer science used to visit all the nodes of a tree. There are several methods to traverse a tree, each with its own use case. In C++, you can implement these traversals using recursion or iterative approaches.

Here are the three common types of tree traversals:

1. **Inorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, root, and right subtree.

2. **Preorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of root, left subtree, and right subtree.

3. **Postorder Traversal**: In this traversal, the nodes are visited in the order of left subtree, right subtree, and root.

Here's a basic implementation of these tree traversals using a binary tree structure in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Define the structure of a node in a binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Recursive function for inorder traversal
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        inorderTraversal(root->left);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        inorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Recursive function for preorder traversal
void preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
        preorderTraversal(root->left);
        preorderTraversal(root->right);
    }
}

// Recursive function for postorder traversal
void postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root != nullptr) {
        postorderTraversal(root->left);
        postorderTraversal(root->right);
        std::cout << root->val << " ";
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Inorder Traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Preorder Traversal: ";
    preorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Postorder Traversal: ";
    postorderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the three types of tree traversals using a simple binary tree structure. You can modify it according to your requirements or extend it to work with other types of trees as well.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree with Maximum Cost

To implement a tree with maximum cost in C++, you would typically use a data structure like a binary tree or an n-ary tree. The "maximum cost" could refer to various things depending on your specific problem, such as maximum sum of values along the path, maximum product, or any other criterion.

Let's assume you want to build a binary tree where each node contains a cost, and you want to find the path from the root to a leaf node that maximizes the sum of costs along that path. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root, int& maxSum) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return 0;

    // Calculate the maximum path sum for the left and right subtrees
    int leftMax = max(0, maxPathSum(root->left, maxSum));
    int rightMax = max(0, maxPathSum(root->right, maxSum));

    // Update the maximum sum found so far
    maxSum = max(maxSum, leftMax + rightMax + root->val);

    // Return the maximum path sum from the current node
    return max(leftMax, rightMax) + root->val;
}

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
    int maxSum = INT_MIN; // Initialize with the smallest possible value
    maxPathSum(root, maxSum);
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(10);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(20);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(-25);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(4);

    cout << "Maximum path sum is " << maxPathSum(root) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree.
- The `maxPathSum` function recursively calculates the maximum path sum starting from each node, keeping track of the maximum sum found so far.
- The `maxPathSum` function is overloaded to provide a convenient interface for the user.
- In the `main` function, an example binary tree is created, and the maximum path sum is printed.

You can modify this code according to your specific problem requirements, such as changing the criterion for determining the maximum cost or using a different type of tree structure.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Count Leaf Nodes

To count the number of leaf nodes in a tree using C++, you typically need a tree data structure. Here's a simple implementation using a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to count the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree
int countLeafNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) // Base case: empty tree
        return 0;
    else if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) // Base case: leaf node
        return 1;
    else
        return countLeafNodes(root->left) + countLeafNodes(root->right); // Recursive case: count leaf nodes in left and right subtrees
}

// Function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);
    return node;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = newNode(1);
    root->left = newNode(2);
    root->right = newNode(3);
    root->left->left = newNode(4);
    root->left->right = newNode(5);
    root->right->left = newNode(6);
    root->right->right = newNode(7);

    // Counting leaf nodes
    int leafCount = countLeafNodes(root);
    cout << "Number of leaf nodes: " << leafCount << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- We define the `TreeNode` structure to represent each node in the binary tree.
- The `countLeafNodes` function recursively traverses the binary tree and counts the leaf nodes.
- In the `main` function, we create a sample binary tree and then call `countLeafNodes` to get the count of leaf nodes.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Count Nodes

To count the nodes in a tree using C++, you can implement a simple recursive algorithm. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to count nodes in a binary tree
int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) // Base case: empty tree
        return 0;
    // Recursive case: count nodes in left and right subtrees and add 1 for the current node
    return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \ /
    //  4  5 6
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);

    // Count nodes
    int nodeCount = countNodes(root);
    std::cout << "Number of nodes in the tree: " << nodeCount << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `countNodes` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and recursively counts the nodes by adding 1 for the current node and recursively counting the nodes in its left and right subtrees. The base case is when the root is nullptr, in which case the count is 0.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Delete Tree

Deleting a tree in C++ involves freeing the memory allocated for each node in the tree. This typically requires a recursive approach to traverse the tree and delete each node. Here's a sample implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void deleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    // Delete left subtree
    deleteTree(root->left);
    // Delete right subtree
    deleteTree(root->right);

    // Delete current node
    delete root;
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    // Deleting the tree
    deleteTree(root);

    // After deletion, root should be nullptr
    if (root == nullptr)
        std::cout << "Tree deleted successfully" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Error: Tree deletion failed" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a `TreeNode` structure representing a node in the binary tree.
2. We define the `deleteTree` function which recursively deletes the tree. It deletes the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
3. In the `main` function, we create a sample tree and then delete it using the `deleteTree` function.
4. We check if the root is `nullptr` after deletion to ensure the tree was deleted successfully.

Remember to use this code carefully, especially in larger programs, to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper memory management.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Height Balanced Binary Tree

Sure, a Height Balanced Binary Tree is a binary tree in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one. Here's a simple implementation of a Height Balanced Binary Tree in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }
    
    int checkHeight(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;
        
        int leftHeight = checkHeight(root->left);
        if (leftHeight == -1)
            return -1;
        
        int rightHeight = checkHeight(root->right);
        if (rightHeight == -1)
            return -1;
        
        int heightDiff = abs(leftHeight - rightHeight);
        if (heightDiff > 1)
            return -1;
        else
            return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` struct defines the structure of a binary tree node.
- The `checkHeight` function is a helper function that recursively computes the height of each subtree while checking for balance. It returns `-1` if the tree is not height balanced, otherwise, it returns the height of the tree.
- The `isBalanced` function checks if the tree is height balanced by calling `checkHeight` and verifying if it returns a valid height or `-1`. If it returns `-1`, the tree is not height balanced, otherwise, it is.

You can use this `Solution` class to create a height-balanced binary tree and check if it's balanced.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Inorder Traversal

In C++, inorder traversal of a binary tree can be implemented using recursion. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    
    // Traverse the left subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    
    // Visit the current node
    cout << root->val << " ";
    
    // Traverse the right subtree
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Creating a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    cout << "Inorder traversal: ";
    inorderTraversal(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct and implements the `inorderTraversal` function to perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree. In the `main` function, a sample binary tree is created and its inorder traversal is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Level Order Traversal

In C++, performing a level order traversal on a tree typically involves using a queue to traverse the tree level by level. Here's how you can implement it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

void levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == NULL) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();

        // Traverse nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            cout << node->val << " ";

            // Enqueue left and right children if they exist
            if (node->left != NULL)
                q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right != NULL)
                q.push(node->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \ / \
    //  4  5 6  7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Level Order Traversal: ";
    levelOrder(root);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a level order traversal of a binary tree. It uses a queue to process each level of the tree. The `levelOrder` function takes the root of the tree as input and prints the nodes level by level.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Post Order Traversal

In C++, you can implement a post-order traversal of a tree using recursion. Here's a basic example of how you can implement post-order traversal for a binary tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void postOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    // Traverse left subtree
    postOrderTraversal(root->left);
    // Traverse right subtree
    postOrderTraversal(root->right);
    // Visit the root
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    std::cout << "Post-order traversal: ";
    postOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

- The `TreeNode` struct represents a node in the binary tree.
- The `postOrderTraversal` function recursively traverses the tree in post-order, visiting the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.
- In the `main` function, we create an example binary tree and call the `postOrderTraversal` function to perform a post-order traversal.

Remember to deallocate memory properly to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Pre Order Traversal

In C++, a pre-order traversal of a tree means visiting the root node first, then recursively visiting the left subtree, followed by visiting the right subtree. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree node and the pre-order traversal algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to perform pre-order traversal
void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Visit the root node
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    
    // Traverse left subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->left);
    
    // Traverse right subtree
    preOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    
    std::cout << "Pre-order traversal of the binary tree: ";
    preOrderTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Clean up allocated memory
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a simple binary tree node structure and the pre-order traversal algorithm applied to it. The `preOrderTraversal` function takes a pointer to the root of the tree and prints the nodes in pre-order. Finally, remember to deallocate the memory allocated for the tree nodes to avoid memory leaks.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Print All Nodes at Level K

To print all nodes at level K in a binary tree, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Here's how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Function to print all nodes at level K
void printNodesAtLevelK(TreeNode* root, int k) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    
    if (k == 0) {
        cout << root->val << " ";
    }
    else {
        printNodesAtLevelK(root->left, k - 1);
        printNodesAtLevelK(root->right, k - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    int k = 2; // Level K

    cout << "Nodes at level " << k << ": ";
    printNodesAtLevelK(root, k);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a TreeNode structure representing each node of the binary tree. The `printNodesAtLevelK` function recursively traverses the tree, decrementing the level `k` until it reaches 0, at which point it prints the value of the current node. The main function creates an example binary tree and calls `printNodesAtLevelK` to print all nodes at level `k`.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Print Level Order

Printing a binary tree in level order (also known as breadth-first traversal) involves traversing the tree level by level, from top to bottom and left to right, and printing the nodes at each level. This can be achieved using a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes at each level. Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void printLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();

        // Print nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            cout << node->val << " ";

            // Enqueue left child
            if (node->left != nullptr) {
                q.push(node->left);
            }

            // Enqueue right child
            if (node->right != nullptr) {
                q.push(node->right);
            }
        }
        cout << endl; // Move to the next level
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    cout << "Level order traversal of binary tree:\n";
    printLevelOrder(root);

    // Clean up memory
    // You should implement a proper cleanup function to avoid memory leaks
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` struct representing each node of the binary tree and a `printLevelOrder` function that performs the level-order traversal using a queue. Finally, in the `main` function, an example binary tree is created and printed using the `printLevelOrder` function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Take Input Level Wise

To take input for a tree level-wise in C++, you can use a queue to store the nodes level by level. Here's a basic approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* takeInputLevelWise() {
    cout << "Enter root value: ";
    int rootData;
    cin >> rootData;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rootData);

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        cout << "Enter left child of " << current->data << " (-1 if none): ";
        int leftData;
        cin >> leftData;
        if (leftData != -1) {
            current->left = new TreeNode(leftData);
            q.push(current->left);
        }

        cout << "Enter right child of " << current->data << " (-1 if none): ";
        int rightData;
        cin >> rightData;
        if (rightData != -1) {
            current->right = new TreeNode(rightData);
            q.push(current->right);
        }
    }

    return root;
}

// Function to print tree (BFS traversal)
void printLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        cout << current->data << " ";

        if (current->left != nullptr) q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right != nullptr) q.push(current->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = takeInputLevelWise();
    cout << "Tree (BFS order): ";
    printLevelOrder(root);
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code allows you to input the tree level-wise. You start with the root node, then for each node, you input its left and right children. `-1` is used to denote that a child doesn't exist. The BFS traversal function `printLevelOrder` is included to verify the input.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Tree: Take Input Recursive

Sure, taking input for a tree recursively in C++ involves traversing the tree in a recursive manner and adding nodes as you encounter them. Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to recursively take input for a binary tree
TreeNode* takeInput() {
    int val;
    cout << "Enter node value (or -1 for NULL): ";
    cin >> val;
    if (val == -1) {
        return nullptr; // NULL node
    }

    // Create a new node
    TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);

    // Recursively take input for left and right subtrees
    cout << "Enter left child of " << val << ":\n";
    newNode->left = takeInput();
    cout << "Enter right child of " << val << ":\n";
    newNode->right = takeInput();

    return newNode;
}

// Function to print the tree inorder (for validation)
void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = takeInput();
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the tree: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code prompts the user to input values for each node of the tree, including `-1` to denote a NULL child. It then constructs the tree recursively based on the user input and finally prints the inorder traversal of the constructed tree for validation.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or assistance!

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): TreeNode Class

Sure, here's a simple implementation of a `TreeNode` class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class TreeNode {
private:
    T data;
    vector<TreeNode*> children;

public:
    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value) {}

    // Destructor to deallocate memory
    ~TreeNode() {
        for (TreeNode* child : children) {
            delete child;
        }
    }

    // Getter for data
    T getData() const {
        return data;
    }

    // Setter for data
    void setData(const T& value) {
        data = value;
    }

    // Add child node
    void addChild(TreeNode* child) {
        children.push_back(child);
    }

    // Get children
    const vector<TreeNode*>& getChildren() const {
        return children;
    }

    // Check if node has children
    bool hasChildren() const {
        return !children.empty();
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- The `TreeNode` class is a generic class, meaning it can hold any type of data.
- It has a constructor that takes the value of the node and initializes the data member.
- The `children` vector stores pointers to child nodes.
- There are methods to get and set data, add child nodes, get children, and check if the node has children.
- The destructor deallocates memory by recursively deleting all child nodes.

You can use this `TreeNode` class to build various tree structures and perform operations on them.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees and Lowest Common Ancestors (Dynammic Programming)

Sure! Trees and Lowest Common Ancestors (LCA) are fundamental concepts in computer science and are frequently used in various algorithms and data structures. Let's break down these topics.

#### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each tree has a root node, and every node in the tree has zero or more child nodes. Some common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees, etc. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as family trees, file systems, organization charts, etc.

In C++, you can implement a simple binary tree like this:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};
```

#### Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

The Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a tree is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants. The LCA can also be a node itself. It's a crucial concept in various tree-related algorithms and problems.

#### Dynamic Programming for LCA

Dynamic programming can be used to efficiently find the LCA of two nodes in a tree. One common approach is to preprocess the tree using techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate information about each node, such as their depths and ancestors. This preprocessing allows for faster queries of LCA later on.

Here's a high-level overview of a dynamic programming approach for finding the LCA:

1. **Preprocessing**: Traverse the tree and store necessary information about each node, like its depth and parent pointers.
2. **Querying LCA**: Given two nodes `p` and `q`, compare their depths. If they are at different depths, move the deeper node up the tree until both nodes are at the same level. Then, traverse upwards from both nodes simultaneously until finding a common ancestor.

Here's a simplified C++ implementation using dynamic programming:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*> parent;
        unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> depth;
        
        // Perform DFS to fill the parent and depth maps
        dfs(root, nullptr, 0, parent, depth);
        
        // Find LCA using dynamic programming
        while (p != q) {
            if (depth[p] > depth[q]) {
                p = parent[p];
            } else if (depth[q] > depth[p]) {
                q = parent[q];
            } else {
                p = parent[p];
                q = parent[q];
            }
        }
        
        return p; // or q, as they are now at the same level
    }
    
private:
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* par, int dep, unordered_map<TreeNode*, TreeNode*>& parent, unordered_map<TreeNode*, int>& depth) {
        if (!node) return;
        parent[node] = par;
        depth[node] = dep;
        dfs(node->left, node, dep + 1, parent, depth);
        dfs(node->right, node, dep + 1, parent, depth);
    }
};
```

This code performs a DFS to preprocess the tree, storing parent nodes and depths for each node. Then, it iteratively moves the deeper node towards the root until both nodes are at the same depth. Finally, it moves both nodes simultaneously towards the root until they meet at the LCA.

This is a basic example, and optimizations can be applied based on specific requirements and constraints.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees and Vectors

Certainly! Trees and vectors are fundamental data structures in computer science, and understanding them is crucial for any programmer. Let's break down each:

#### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes. Each tree has a root node, and every node in the tree has zero or more child nodes. Here are some common types of trees:

1. **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
3. **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and maintaining efficient operations.
4. **Heap**: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues.

Operations on trees include traversal (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order), insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing.

#### Vectors

Vectors, also known as dynamic arrays or ArrayLists in other languages, are sequential containers in C++ that store elements in contiguous memory locations. Vectors offer dynamic resizing, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed. Here are some key points about vectors:

- **Dynamic Size**: Vectors can resize themselves automatically when elements are added or removed, providing flexibility.
- **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed randomly in constant time using array-like indexing.
- **Efficient Iteration**: Iterating over elements in a vector is efficient due to contiguous memory allocation.
- **Insertion and Deletion**: Insertion and deletion operations can be slower than at the beginning or end of the vector because elements may need to be shifted.

Vectors are part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, and they offer a wide range of operations and functionalities, including element access, modification, resizing, sorting, and searching.

In C++, trees are usually implemented using pointers, while vectors are provided as part of the standard library. Combining these two data structures can lead to efficient solutions for various programming problems, especially when dealing with data that has hierarchical relationships or when dynamic resizing is required.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees Vectors

In C++, a tree data structure can be implemented using various techniques, with one of the most common being the use of classes and pointers. Here's a basic implementation of a binary tree using classes and vectors for dynamic memory allocation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Node structure for the binary tree
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Binary Tree class
class BinaryTree {
private:
    TreeNode* root;

public:
    // Constructor
    BinaryTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Destructor
    ~BinaryTree() {
        destroyTree(root);
    }

    // Function to recursively destroy the tree
    void destroyTree(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node) {
            destroyTree(node->left);
            destroyTree(node->right);
            delete node;
        }
    }

    // Function to insert a value into the binary tree
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRecursive(root, value);
    }

    // Recursive function to insert a value into the binary tree
    TreeNode* insertRecursive(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return new TreeNode(value);
        }

        if (value < node->data) {
            node->left = insertRecursive(node->left, value);
        } else if (value > node->data) {
            node->right = insertRecursive(node->right, value);
        }

        return node;
    }

    // Function to perform inorder traversal of the binary tree
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* node) {
        if (node) {
            inorderTraversal(node->left);
            cout << node->data << " ";
            inorderTraversal(node->right);
        }
    }

    // Function to print inorder traversal of the binary tree
    void printInorder() {
        inorderTraversal(root);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a binary tree
    BinaryTree tree;

    // Inserting values into the binary tree
    tree.insert(50);
    tree.insert(30);
    tree.insert(20);
    tree.insert(40);
    tree.insert(70);
    tree.insert(60);
    tree.insert(80);

    // Printing inorder traversal of the binary tree
    cout << "Inorder traversal of the binary tree: ";
    tree.printInorder();

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements a basic binary tree with insertion and printing capabilities. Instead of using pointers for left and right child nodes, it uses vectors to store child nodes. You can extend this implementation by adding other functionalities like deletion, searching, etc., as per your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Level Width

In C++, to find the width of each level in a tree, you typically perform a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree while keeping track of the number of nodes at each level. Here's a simple implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int widthOfLevel(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int maxWidth = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelWidth = q.size();
        maxWidth = max(maxWidth, levelWidth);

        // Process all nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelWidth; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            // Enqueue the children of the current node
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return maxWidth;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    //      1
    //     / \
    //    2   3
    //   / \   \
    //  4   5   6
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    cout << "Width of each level: " << widthOfLevel(root) << endl;

    // Free memory (not necessary in some environments but good practice)
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the width of each level in the tree using a queue-based level-order traversal. It iterates through each level, counting the number of nodes at each level and updating the maximum width encountered so far. Finally, it returns the maximum width.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Measuring Level Width

Measuring the width of each level in a tree involves counting the number of nodes at each level. You can accomplish this using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. In C++, you can implement this with the help of queues. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Tree node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(int value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the width of each level in the tree
void levelWidth(Node* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int width = q.size(); // Width of current level
        cout << width << " "; // Output the width

        // Enqueue children of all nodes at current level
        while (width--) {
            Node* current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (current->left)
                q.push(current->left);
            if (current->right)
                q.push(current->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree
    Node* root = new Node(1);
    root->left = new Node(2);
    root->right = new Node(3);
    root->left->left = new Node(4);
    root->left->right = new Node(5);
    root->right->right = new Node(6);

    // Output the width of each level
    cout << "Width of each level: ";
    levelWidth(root);
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This program creates a binary tree and then calculates the width of each level using a BFS approach. It utilizes a queue to perform the breadth-first traversal. The `levelWidth` function iterates through each level, counting the number of nodes at each level and outputting the width.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Node Implementation

Sure! Implementing a tree node in C++ is relatively straightforward. You typically define a struct or a class representing a node, which contains the data and pointers to its children.

Here's a simple example of how you can implement a binary tree node in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
struct TreeNode {
    T data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(const T& value) : data(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

int main() {
    // Creating nodes
    TreeNode<int>* root = new TreeNode<int>(10);
    TreeNode<int>* leftChild = new TreeNode<int>(5);
    TreeNode<int>* rightChild = new TreeNode<int>(15);

    // Connecting nodes
    root->left = leftChild;
    root->right = rightChild;

    // Accessing node data
    std::cout << "Root data: " << root->data << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Left child data: " << root->left->data << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Right child data: " << root->right->data << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root;
    delete leftChild;
    delete rightChild;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We define a `TreeNode` struct that contains the data of type `T`, and pointers to left and right children.
- We create nodes using the `new` keyword.
- We connect the nodes by assigning the left and right pointers of the root node to the left and right child nodes, respectively.
- We access the data of nodes using the `->` operator.
- Finally, we clean up the memory using the `delete` keyword to avoid memory leaks.

Remember, this is a basic implementation. Depending on the type of tree (binary, binary search tree, AVL tree, etc.), you may need to add additional members and methods to the `TreeNode` struct or class.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Traverse By Breadth

Traversing a tree by breadth-first search (BFS) is a common way to explore or search through the nodes of a tree. It visits all the nodes at a particular depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Here's how you can implement breadth-first traversal in C++ using a queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void breadthFirstTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;

    std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        std::cout << current->val << " ";

        if (current->left != nullptr)
            q.push(current->left);
        if (current->right != nullptr)
            q.push(current->right);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //        1
    //       / \
    //      2   3
    //     / \ / \
    //    4  5 6  7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    std::cout << "Breadth-First Traversal: ";
    breadthFirstTraversal(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code first creates a simple binary tree and then performs a breadth-first traversal starting from the root node. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited, pushing each node's children onto the queue as they are encountered.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Trees: Tree Width with Level Width

To find the width of a tree at each level, you can use a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. Here's how you can do it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Tree Node
struct TreeNode {
    int data;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;

    TreeNode(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Function to find the width of the tree at each level
vector<int> treeWidth(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return {};

    vector<int> widths;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelWidth = q.size(); // Number of nodes at current level
        widths.push_back(levelWidth);

        // Process all nodes at this level and enqueue their children
        while (levelWidth--) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return widths;
}

int main() {
    // Example tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    // Get the width of the tree at each level
    vector<int> widths = treeWidth(root);

    // Output the width at each level
    cout << "Width of the tree at each level: ";
    for (int width : widths) {
        cout << width << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a structure for tree nodes, along with a function `treeWidth` that calculates the width of the tree at each level using BFS traversal. Finally, in the `main` function, an example tree is created, and the width at each level is printed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Types of trees

In C++, trees are a fundamental data structure used in various algorithms and applications. There are several types of trees, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some common types:

1. **Binary Tree**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left child of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

3. **AVL Tree**: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property ensures that the tree remains balanced, maintaining O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

4. **Red-Black Tree**: A red-black tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance using color properties and rotation operations. Red-black trees guarantee that the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, ensuring O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.

5. **B-Tree**: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems where large amounts of data need to be stored efficiently on disk.

6. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a common prefix of its children. Tries are efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting strings, especially in applications like autocomplete and spell check.

7. **Heap**: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a binary heap, for example, if A is a parent node of B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B. This allows for efficient implementation of priority queues.

8. **Ternary Search Tree (TST)**: A ternary search tree is a type of trie (prefix tree) where each node has up to three children instead of the usual two in binary trees. Ternary search trees are useful for storing and searching a dictionary of strings efficiently.

These are just a few examples of the types of trees used in C++ programming. Each type has its own advantages and use cases, so choosing the right one depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Why Do You Need Balanced Trees?

Balanced trees, such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees, are crucial in computer science and programming for several reasons:

1. **Efficient Searching, Insertion, and Deletion**: Balanced trees maintain their height in such a way that the worst-case time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations remains logarithmic (O(log n)). This makes them highly efficient for handling large datasets.

2. **Preventing Degeneration**: In unbalanced trees like a linear linked list or a skewed binary tree, the time complexity for operations can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements. Balancing techniques ensure that the tree remains balanced, preventing such degeneration.

3. **Optimized Performance**: Balanced trees provide a balance between space efficiency and time efficiency. While they may consume slightly more memory due to additional pointers or metadata, they guarantee faster operations, making them suitable for applications where performance is critical.

4. **Support for Range Queries**: Some balanced trees, like B-trees, are particularly useful for range queries and operations involving intervals. They maintain an ordered structure that facilitates efficient range searches.

5. **Concurrency and Transaction Management**: In database systems and concurrent environments, balanced trees play a crucial role in ensuring efficient transaction management and concurrency control. They provide a foundation for implementing data structures like transaction logs and indexing mechanisms.

6. **Consistent Performance**: Unlike hash tables, which might suffer from occasional worst-case scenarios leading to O(n) time complexity, balanced trees offer consistent performance guarantees across different datasets and operations.

In summary, balanced trees are essential in algorithm and data structure design because they offer efficient, reliable, and predictable performance for various operations on dynamic datasets, making them a fundamental building block in computer science and software engineering.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Why Tree?

Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science with various applications and advantages:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Trees are ideal for representing hierarchical relationships. For instance, file systems on a computer, organizational charts in a company, or the structure of a webpage in HTML all can be represented as trees.

2. **Efficient Searching**: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees. This makes them suitable for implementing dictionary operations like search, insert, and delete.

3. **Ordered Data**: Binary Search Trees store data in sorted order, which makes in-order traversal yield elements in sorted order. This property is useful in applications where sorted data is required, like finding the k-th smallest or largest element in a set.

4. **Efficient Operations**: Various operations like finding the minimum/maximum element, finding the successor/predecessor of an element, and range queries can be performed efficiently on trees.

5. **Balanced Trees**: Balanced trees like AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and B-trees ensure that the height of the tree remains balanced, resulting in guaranteed time complexities for operations, preventing worst-case scenarios.

6. **Space Efficiency**: Trees occupy less space compared to other data structures like hash tables since they don't require as much overhead space. This can be crucial in memory-constrained environments.

7. **Versatility**: Trees can be modified and extended to suit different requirements. There are various types of trees such as Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, B-trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Segment Trees, and so on, each designed to optimize specific operations or scenarios.

8. **Graph Representation**: Trees are a specific type of graph without cycles. They can be used to represent graph structures efficiently, especially for algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's for finding Minimum Spanning Trees.

In C++, you have the flexibility to implement trees using pointers or smart pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation and efficient manipulation of tree structures. Overall, trees offer a versatile and efficient way to organize and manipulate data in a wide range of applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): ZigZag Level Order Traversal

Zigzag level order traversal is a traversal method for binary trees where you visit the nodes level by level, alternating the direction in which you visit each level. Here's a C++ implementation using a queue and a stack:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    if (root == nullptr) return result;

    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    bool leftToRight = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        vector<int> level(size);
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int index = (leftToRight) ? i : (size - 1 - i);
            level[index] = node->val;
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
        result.push_back(level);
        leftToRight = !leftToRight;
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    // Create a binary tree
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    // Get the zigzag level order traversal
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagTraversal = zigzagLevelOrder(root);

    // Output the result
    for (const auto& level : zigzagTraversal) {
        for (int val : level) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

This code does a breadth-first traversal of the binary tree, but it alternates the direction in which it reads each level, going from left to right on odd levels and from right to left on even levels.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Graphs: Exercise: Minimal Tree

Certainly! The exercise "Minimal Tree" typically involves constructing a binary search tree from a sorted array with minimal height. Here's a general approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* minimalTree(const vector<int>& sortedArray, int start, int end) {
    if (start > end) {
        return nullptr;
    }
    
    int mid = (start + end) / 2;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(sortedArray[mid]);
    
    root->left = minimalTree(sortedArray, start, mid - 1);
    root->right = minimalTree(sortedArray, mid + 1, end);
    
    return root;
}

TreeNode* minimalTree(const vector<int>& sortedArray) {
    return minimalTree(sortedArray, 0, sortedArray.size() - 1);
}

// Function to print inorder traversal of the tree (for testing)
void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    
    inorderTraversal(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> sortedArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    TreeNode* root = minimalTree(sortedArray);
    
    // Print inorder traversal of the tree (to verify)
    inorderTraversal(root);
    
    // Don't forget to free the memory to avoid memory leaks
    // Implementation of freeing memory is left out for simplicity
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a struct `TreeNode` for the binary tree nodes and provides a function `minimalTree` to construct the minimal binary search tree from a sorted array. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with a sorted array of integers. You can add more functionality or modify it according to your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Editing Sorted Trees

Editing sorted trees in C++ typically involves operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching while maintaining the sorted order of the tree. One common data structure for this purpose is the binary search tree (BST). Here's a brief overview of how you can perform these operations:

1. **Insertion**:
   - To insert a new node into a BST while maintaining the sorted order, you start at the root and compare the value of the new node with the current node.
   - If the new node's value is less than the current node's value, you move to the left subtree; if it's greater, you move to the right subtree.
   - Repeat this process until you reach a leaf node (a node with no children) where the new node should be inserted. Then, insert the new node as a child of that leaf node.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Deleting a node from a BST while maintaining the sorted order requires special consideration to preserve the properties of a BST.
   - If the node to be deleted has no children, simply remove it from the tree.
   - If the node has only one child, replace the node with its child.
   - If the node has two children, find the node with the next highest value (successor) in the tree (typically the leftmost node in the right subtree or the rightmost node in the left subtree).
   - Replace the node to be deleted with its successor, and then delete the successor node from its original location.

3. **Searching**:
   - Searching in a BST is straightforward. Start at the root and compare the target value with the value of the current node.
   - If the target value is equal to the current node's value, you've found the node.
   - If the target value is less than the current node's value, move to the left subtree.
   - If the target value is greater than the current node's value, move to the right subtree.
   - Repeat this process until you find the node or reach a leaf node (indicating the target value is not in the tree).

When implementing these operations, remember to consider edge cases such as handling duplicates (depending on the requirements of your application), handling empty trees, and ensuring proper memory management (e.g., deallocating memory for deleted nodes). Additionally, you might want to consider balancing techniques like AVL trees or Red-Black trees to maintain the tree's height balance, which can improve the efficiency of operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): 2-3 Trees

2-3 trees are balanced search trees that provide efficient insertion, deletion, and searching operations. They are a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node can contain either one or two keys and has two or three children nodes.

Here's a brief overview of the properties and operations of 2-3 trees:

#### Properties

1. **Binary Search Tree Property**: For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than its key, and all keys in its right subtree are greater than its key.
2. **Balanced Structure**: All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring a balanced tree.
3. **Node Structure**:
   - Each node can have either one key and two children or two keys and three children.
   - For a node with one key, it has two child nodes.
   - For a node with two keys, it has three child nodes.

#### Operations

1. **Insertion**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree to find the appropriate leaf node for insertion.
   - If the leaf node has only one key, insert the new key into it.
   - If the leaf node has two keys, split the node into three and promote the middle key to its parent.
   - Continue splitting and promoting keys upwards until the tree's balance is restored.

2. **Deletion**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree to find the node containing the key to be deleted.
   - If the node is a leaf node, simply remove the key from it.
   - If the node is an internal node, replace the key to be deleted with its predecessor or successor, then delete the predecessor or successor from its appropriate leaf node.
   - If necessary, perform rotations or merges to maintain the properties of the 2-3 tree.

3. **Search**:
   - Start from the root and recursively traverse down the tree, comparing the search key with the keys in each node.
   - If the key is found, return the corresponding value.
   - If the key is not found, continue searching in the appropriate subtree until a leaf node is reached.

#### C++ Implementation

```cpp
// Node structure for 2-3 tree
struct Node {
    int key1;
    int key2;
    Node* child1;
    Node* child2;
    Node* child3;
    bool isTwoNode; // true if node has one key, false if node has two keys
};

class TwoThreeTree {
private:
    Node* root;

    // Helper functions for insertion, deletion, and search

public:
    TwoThreeTree() : root(nullptr) {}

    // Function declarations for insertion, deletion, and search
};
```

Implementing 2-3 trees in C++ involves managing the node structure and implementing the insertion, deletion, and search algorithms while maintaining the balance and properties of the tree. These operations can be a bit complex due to the need for node splitting, merging, and promotions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): 2-3-4 Trees

2-3-4 trees are a type of self-balancing search tree where each node can have 2, 3, or 4 child nodes. They are similar to red-black trees but are more generalized and can hold more keys per node.

In a 2-3-4 tree:

1. **Node Structure**: Each node can hold 1, 2, or 3 keys and 2, 3, or 4 child pointers respectively.
2. **Balanced Structure**: All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring a balanced tree.
3. **Search Operation**: Searching for an element in a 2-3-4 tree follows the same principles as in a binary search tree. You compare the search key with the keys in the nodes, and based on the comparison, you traverse either the left or right child subtree.
4. **Insertion Operation**: Insertion in a 2-3-4 tree involves finding the appropriate leaf node for the new key and then inserting it into that node. If the node becomes overfull (i.e., has more than 3 keys after insertion), it splits into two nodes, and the middle key is moved up to the parent node. This process may propagate up the tree if necessary.
5. **Deletion Operation**: Deleting a key from a 2-3-4 tree involves similar steps to insertion. If a node becomes underfull after deletion (i.e., has fewer than 2 keys), it may borrow a key from a sibling node or merge with a sibling node, redistributing keys appropriately.
6. **Splitting and Merging**: When a node splits, the middle key moves up to the parent node, and the remaining keys form two new nodes. When merging nodes, a key from the parent node moves down to the merged node, and the two nodes combine to form a single node.
7. **Complexity**: The height of a balanced 2-3-4 tree containing \( n \) keys is \( O(\log n) \), resulting in efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Implementing a 2-3-4 tree involves handling various cases during insertion and deletion to maintain the properties of the tree. It's slightly more complex compared to binary search trees but offers better balance and guarantees logarithmic time complexity for operations.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Decision Trees

Decision trees are a fundamental concept in both machine learning and computer science. They are versatile tools used for classification and regression tasks, among others. Here's an overview of decision trees in the context of algorithms and data structures in C++:

#### Decision Tree Structure

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a decision tree contains:
   - A decision (or split) based on a feature.
   - References (pointers or indices) to child nodes.

2. **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes that represent the output (classification or regression result).

#### Construction of Decision Trees

1. **Splitting Criteria**:
   - Choose the best feature to split on at each node. Common criteria include Gini impurity, entropy, or information gain for classification; mean squared error reduction for regression.

2. **Stopping Criteria**:
   - Define conditions to stop splitting, like maximum tree depth, minimum samples per leaf, or minimum impurity decrease.

3. **Recursive Splitting**:
   - Recursively split the dataset based on selected features until stopping criteria are met.

#### Key Operations

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Build the decision tree by recursively selecting the best split at each node until termination conditions are satisfied.

2. **Prediction**:
   - Traverse the decision tree based on input features until reaching a leaf node, then return the output.

#### Implementation in C++

1. **Node Structure**: Define a struct or class representing each node, storing feature index, split value, pointers to child nodes, and output value for leaf nodes.

2. **Construction Functions**: Write functions to recursively construct the decision tree by selecting the best split and partitioning the dataset.

3. **Prediction Function**: Implement a function to traverse the decision tree based on input features and return the predicted output.

4. **Stopping Conditions**: Define conditions to stop splitting and convert a node into a leaf node.

5. **Splitting Criteria**: Implement functions to calculate impurity measures and select the best split.

#### Libraries

While you can implement decision trees from scratch, many C++ libraries offer efficient implementations, such as:

- **MLPACK**: Provides decision tree functionality along with other machine learning algorithms.
- **Dlib**: Includes a decision tree implementation among its various machine learning tools.
- **Scikit-Learn (with C++ Interface)**: Utilize the C++ interface of Scikit-Learn, a popular Python library, for decision tree functionality.

#### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Define Node structure
struct Node {
    int featureIndex;
    double splitValue;
    std::vector<Node*> children;
    double output; // For leaf nodes
};

// Function to build decision tree
Node* buildDecisionTree(std::vector<std::vector<double>>& data) {
    // Implement tree construction logic here
}

// Function to make predictions
double predict(Node* root, std::vector<double>& input) {
    // Implement prediction logic here
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    // Define dataset
    std::vector<std::vector<double>> data = {{2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0}, /*...*/};
    
    // Build decision tree
    Node* root = buildDecisionTree(data);
    
    // Make predictions
    std::vector<double> input = {1.0, 2.0};
    double prediction = predict(root, input);
    
    std::cout << "Prediction: " << prediction << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, you'd implement the `buildDecisionTree` function to construct the decision tree and the `predict` function to traverse the tree for predictions.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Analysis of n-Ary Trees

Analyzing n-ary trees involves examining their properties, operations, and complexities. An n-ary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node can have at most n children. Analyzing n-ary trees often involves understanding various operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal, along with their associated time complexities.

Let's dive into the analysis of n-ary trees:

#### Properties of n-ary Trees

1. **Node Structure**: Each node in an n-ary tree typically contains a key or value and pointers/references to its children nodes.
2. **Root**: The topmost node in the tree.
3. **Parent & Child Relationship**: Each node has at most n children, forming a parent-child relationship.
4. **Height**: The height of an n-ary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
5. **Depth**: The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to that node.
6. **Degree**: Maximum number of children a node can have, which is 'n' in the case of an n-ary tree.

#### Operations and Time Complexities

1. **Insertion**: Inserting a node into an n-ary tree can be done by finding the appropriate parent node and adding the new node as its child. The time complexity depends on the tree's structure and insertion position. In the worst-case scenario, it can be O(n) if the tree is skewed.

2. **Deletion**: Deleting a node from an n-ary tree involves finding the node to be deleted and removing its reference from its parent's child list. Similar to insertion, the time complexity can be O(n) in the worst case.

3. **Searching**: Searching for a node in an n-ary tree involves traversing the tree. In the worst case, where the node is at the bottom-right corner of the tree, the time complexity is O(n).

4. **Traversal**:
   - **Depth-First Traversals**: Depth-first traversal methods like Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals can be applied to n-ary trees. They have a time complexity of O(n).
   - **Breadth-First Traversal**: Breadth-first traversal (Level-order traversal) involves visiting all nodes of a level before proceeding to the next level. It also has a time complexity of O(n).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of n-ary trees mainly depends on the maximum number of nodes at any level. In the worst case, where the tree is complete, the space complexity is O(n).

#### Applications

n-ary trees are used in various applications, including file systems, organization hierarchies, syntax trees in compiler design, and more. Their flexible structure makes them suitable for representing hierarchical data.

Understanding the properties and operations of n-ary trees is essential for designing efficient algorithms and data structures in scenarios where hierarchical data needs to be managed and processed.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Balanced Trees

Balanced trees are fundamental data structures in computer science that help maintain efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. They aim to keep the tree balanced to ensure that the height of the tree remains relatively small, leading to faster operations.

In C++, some commonly used balanced trees include:

1. **AVL Trees**: Named after their inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis, AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If this condition is violated after an insertion or deletion operation, rotations are performed to rebalance the tree.

2. **Red-Black Trees**: Red-Black trees are another type of self-balancing binary search trees. They ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced by enforcing five properties, including coloring nodes either red or black and performing rotations and color flips to maintain balance.

3. **Splay Trees**: Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees where recently accessed elements are quickly accessed again. In a splay tree, whenever an element is accessed, it is moved to the root of the tree by performing a series of rotations called "splays". Splay trees do not strictly maintain a specific balance criterion but have good amortized performance.

4. **B-Trees**: B-Trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disk or other secondary storage devices. They are widely used in databases and file systems for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching. B-Trees maintain a sorted order and balance by allowing each node to have more than two children.

Each type of balanced tree has its advantages and use cases. Choosing the appropriate balanced tree depends on factors such as the specific requirements of the application, the frequency of insertion and deletion operations, memory constraints, and expected performance characteristics.

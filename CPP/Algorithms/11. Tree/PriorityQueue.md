### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Data Structure : Priority Queue

A Priority Queue is a data structure similar to a regular queue, but each element in the queue has a priority associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. This means that elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `std::priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(15);

    // Accessing the top element of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Top element of the priority queue: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after popping: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* We include the necessary header files (`#include <iostream>` and `#include <queue>`).
* We declare a priority queue `pq` of integers (`std::priority_queue<int>`).
* We insert elements into the priority queue using the `push()` method.
* We access the top element of the priority queue using the `top()` method.
* We remove the top element from the priority queue using the `pop()` method.
* Finally, we access the new top element after popping.

The priority queue in C++ is implemented as a max-heap by default, meaning that the element with the highest value has the highest priority. If you want to change the priority queue to behave like a min-heap, where the element with the lowest value has the highest priority, you can specify a different comparison function as the second template parameter of `std::priority_queue`. For example:

```cpp
// Declaration of a priority queue of integers, with a custom comparison function
std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> pq;
```

This declaration creates a priority queue of integers where the element with the smallest value has the highest priority.

Priority queues are commonly used in algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in graphs and in implementing algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees. They are also used in various scheduling algorithms and in simulating systems where tasks have different priorities.


### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are Priority Queues ?

Priority queues are abstract data types similar to regular queues but with an added priority associated with each element. In a priority queue, elements are removed based on their priority rather than the order in which they were added.

In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority value, and elements with higher priority values are dequeued before elements with lower priority values. Priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, which allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest (or lowest, depending on the implementation) priority element.

In C++, priority queues are provided as part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and can be found in the `<queue>` header. They are implemented as container adaptors, meaning they internally use a container such as a vector or a deque to manage the elements, and provide a high-level interface for operations like insertion and deletion based on priority.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of priority queues in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print elements of the priority queue
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, elements (integers) are inserted into the priority queue using the `push()` method, and then they are printed in sorted order (highest to lowest) using the `top()` method to access the highest priority element and `pop()` method to remove it from the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are priority queues?

Priority queues are a type of data structure used in computer science to store elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority, and elements with higher priorities are dequeued before those with lower priorities.

In C++, priority queues are typically implemented using binary heaps, although other data structures like Fibonacci heaps can also be used. Binary heaps are complete binary trees where each node satisfies the heap property, meaning that the priority of a parent node is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the priorities of its children.

C++ provides a `std::priority_queue` container adapter in the `<queue>` header that implements a priority queue using a binary heap. It allows elements to be inserted with a specified priority and supports operations like insertion, extraction of the top element, and checking whether the priority queue is empty.

Here's a basic example of how to use `std::priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a max priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> maxPriorityQueue;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    maxPriorityQueue.push(30);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(10);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(50);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    maxPriorityQueue.pop();

    // Printing the top element again
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `maxPriorityQueue` is a priority queue that stores integers in a max heap, so the element with the highest value will have the highest priority. The `push()` function is used to insert elements, `top()` retrieves the highest priority element without removing it, and `pop()` removes the highest priority element from the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Ways to implement Priority Queue

In C++, there are several ways to implement a priority queue, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few common methods:

1. **Using Standard Template Library (STL)**:
   The simplest way to implement a priority queue in C++ is to use the `std::priority_queue` class provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). It internally uses a heap data structure to maintain the elements in priority order. Here's a basic example:

   ```cpp
   #include <queue>

   int main() {
       std::priority_queue<int> pq;

       pq.push(5);
       pq.push(2);
       pq.push(10);

       while (!pq.empty()) {
           std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
           pq.pop();
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This would output: `10 5 2`

2. **Using Heap Operations**:
   You can also implement a priority queue using heap operations directly, without relying on the `std::priority_queue` class. This gives you more control over the underlying data structure. You can implement your own heap or use functions like `std::make_heap`, `std::push_heap`, and `std::pop_heap`. Here's a simple example:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <algorithm>

   int main() {
       std::vector<int> heap = {5, 2, 10};

       std::make_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());

       while (!heap.empty()) {
           std::cout << heap.front() << " ";
           std::pop_heap(heap.begin(), heap.end());
           heap.pop_back();
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This would also output: `10 5 2`

3. **Using Binary Search Trees (BST)**:
   Another approach is to use a binary search tree (BST) to implement a priority queue. You can use a self-balancing BST like AVL tree or Red-Black tree to maintain the elements in sorted order. This approach allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements while maintaining sorted order. However, it may not provide the same performance guarantees as using a heap-based approach.

4. **Using an Array or Linked List**:
   While less efficient, you can implement a priority queue using an array or linked list and manually maintain the sorted order of elements. However, this approach typically has worse time complexity for operations like insertion and deletion compared to heap-based implementations.

The choice of implementation depends on factors such as the specific requirements of your application, expected performance characteristics, and ease of implementation. Typically, for most use cases, the `std::priority_queue` from the STL suffices due to its simplicity and good performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are Priority Queues ?

Priority queues are abstract data types similar to regular queues but with an added priority associated with each element. In a priority queue, elements are removed based on their priority rather than the order in which they were added.

In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority value, and elements with higher priority values are dequeued before elements with lower priority values. Priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, which allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest (or lowest, depending on the implementation) priority element.

In C++, priority queues are provided as part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and can be found in the `<queue>` header. They are implemented as container adaptors, meaning they internally use a container such as a vector or a deque to manage the elements, and provide a high-level interface for operations like insertion and deletion based on priority.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of priority queues in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print elements of the priority queue
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, elements (integers) are inserted into the priority queue using the `push()` method, and then they are printed in sorted order (highest to lowest) using the `top()` method to access the highest priority element and `pop()` method to remove it from the queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): What are priority queues?

Priority queues are a type of data structure used in computer science to store elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority, and elements with higher priorities are dequeued before those with lower priorities.

#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a max priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> maxPriorityQueue;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    maxPriorityQueue.push(30);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(10);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(50);
    maxPriorityQueue.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    maxPriorityQueue.pop();

    // Printing the top element again
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << maxPriorityQueue.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `maxPriorityQueue` is a priority queue that stores integers in a max heap, so the element with the highest value will have the highest priority. The `push()` function is used to insert elements, `top()` retrieves the highest priority element without removing it, and `pop()` removes the highest priority element from the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Implementation of Priority Queue

Sure, I can provide you with a simple implementation of a priority queue in C++ using a binary heap. Here's a basic example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<T> heap;

    // Helper functions
    int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; }
    int left(int i) { return 2 * i + 1; }
    int right(int i) { return 2 * i + 2; }

    // Maintains heap property by moving the element up
    void heapifyUp(int i) {
        while (i > 0 && heap[parent(i)] < heap[i]) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[parent(i)]);
            i = parent(i);
        }
    }

    // Maintains heap property by moving the element down
    void heapifyDown(int i) {
        int maxIndex = i;
        int l = left(i);
        int r = right(i);

        if (l < heap.size() && heap[l] > heap[maxIndex])
            maxIndex = l;
        if (r < heap.size() && heap[r] > heap[maxIndex])
            maxIndex = r;

        if (i != maxIndex) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[maxIndex]);
            heapifyDown(maxIndex);
        }
    }

public:
    // Insert element into the priority queue
    void insert(T element) {
        heap.push_back(element);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    // Remove the highest priority element from the queue
    T extractMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }

        T max = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap.back();
        heap.pop_back();
        heapifyDown(0);

        return max;
    }

    // Get the highest priority element without removing it
    T getMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }
        return heap[0];
    }

    // Check if the priority queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return heap.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.insert(5);
    pq.insert(10);
    pq.insert(3);
    pq.insert(7);

    // Print and remove elements from the priority queue
    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        cout << pq.extractMax() << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a max-heap to implement the priority queue. The `insert` function inserts an element into the priority queue, the `extractMax` function removes and returns the highest priority element, the `getMax` function returns the highest priority element without removing it, and the `isEmpty` function checks if the priority queue is empty.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt Min Priority Queue

In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) to work with a min priority queue. The `std::priority_queue` container in C++ STL is by default a max heap, but you can make it behave like a min heap by providing a custom comparator. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of min priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;

    // Inserting elements into the min heap
    minHeap.push(5);
    minHeap.push(2);
    minHeap.push(8);
    minHeap.push(1);
    minHeap.push(3);

    // Accessing the top element of the min heap
    std::cout << "Top element of min heap: " << minHeap.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element from the min heap
    minHeap.pop();
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << minHeap.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the code above:

* `std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>>` declares a min priority queue of integers. The third template argument `std::greater<int>` specifies the comparison function, making it a min heap. `std::greater<int>` is a functor that returns true if the first argument is greater than the second, thus making the priority queue behave like a min heap.

* `push()` is used to insert elements into the priority queue.

* `top()` returns a reference to the top (minimum) element of the priority queue.

* `pop()` removes the top element from the priority queue.

This is a simple example of using a min priority queue in C++ using the STL. You can customize it based on your specific requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Inbuilt Priority Queue

In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue efficiently. Priority queues are a type of container adapters, which are specifically designed to operate in a way that the elements with the highest priority are served before elements with lower priority. Here's a brief overview of how to use the inbuilt priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority element) of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element from the priority queue
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the top element after removal
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    std::cout << "Is priority queue empty? " << (pq.empty() ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    // Size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

* We include the `<queue>` header, which provides the priority queue functionality.
* We create a priority queue `pq` of integers using `std::priority_queue<int>`.
* We can push elements into the priority queue using the `push()` method.
* To access the top element (the element with the highest priority), we use the `top()` method.
* To remove the top element, we use the `pop()` method.
* We can check if the priority queue is empty using the `empty()` method.
* The `size()` method returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

The elements are arranged in the priority queue in such a way that the element with the highest priority (maximum value by default for integers) is at the top. You can also define your custom comparison function to change the priority order based on your requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue

A priority queue is a fundamental data structure in computer science that manages a set of elements each associated with a priority. It allows for efficient access to the element with the highest (or lowest) priority. In C++, the `std::priority_queue` is available in the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue.

Here's a basic example of how to use `std::priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Access the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Remove the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Access the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Check if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty())
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Priority queue is not empty\n";

    // Get the size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* `std::priority_queue<int>` creates a priority queue of integers. You can specify the type of the elements inside the angle brackets (`<>`).
* `pq.push(value)` inserts an element into the priority queue.
* `pq.top()` returns the top element (element with the highest priority) without removing it.
* `pq.pop()` removes the top element from the priority queue.
* `pq.empty()` checks if the priority queue is empty.
* `pq.size()` returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

You can also define your own comparison function for custom priorities or use a custom data type with its own comparison function. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

struct CustomType {
    int value;
    // Define a comparison function for CustomType
    bool operator<(const CustomType& other) const {
        return value < other.value; // Change < to > for min priority queue
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a priority queue of CustomType
    std::priority_queue

```cpp


```cpp
    <CustomType> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push({10});
    pq.push({30});
    pq.push({20});

    // Access the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top().value << std::endl;

    // Remove the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Access the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top().value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `CustomType` is a custom data type with an integer value. We overload the `<` operator to define the comparison based on the `value` member variable. This allows us to use `CustomType` with `std::priority_queue`, and the priority queue will be ordered based on the `value` of each element.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue Problems

Sure, priority queues are an essential data structure in computer science, often implemented using heaps. They are commonly used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, among others. Here are a few classic problems that you can solve using priority queues in C++:

1. **Merge K Sorted Lists**:
   Given K sorted lists, merge them into one sorted list. You can use a priority queue to efficiently merge them.

2. **Top K Frequent Elements**:
   Given an array of integers, return the K most frequent elements. You can use a priority queue to keep track of the frequency of elements.

3. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**:
   Given an unsorted array of integers, find the Kth largest element. You can use a min-heap to efficiently find the Kth largest element.

4. **Find Median from Data Stream**:
   Design a data structure that supports adding integers to the data structure and finding the median of the elements currently present. You can use two priority queues, one for the smaller half of the elements (max-heap) and one for the larger half (min-heap).

5. **Task Scheduler**:
   Given a sequence of tasks represented by characters, each task could be done in one interval. You need to find the minimum time to finish all the tasks, given a non-negative integer n, which represents the cooldown interval between two same tasks. You can use a priority queue to schedule the tasks efficiently.

6. **Huffman Coding**:
   Huffman coding is a method used for lossless data compression. Given a set of characters and their frequencies, build a Huffman tree and generate the Huffman codes for each character. Priority queues are used to build the Huffman tree efficiently.

7. **Super Ugly Number**:
   Write a program to find the nth super ugly number. Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k. You can use a priority queue to generate super ugly numbers efficiently.

These are just a few examples of problems that can be solved using priority queues in C++. Each of these problems requires understanding the priority queue operations like insertion, deletion, and accessing the top element efficiently.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue STL

A priority queue is a data structure that maintains a set of elements, each associated with a priority. Its primary operations are inserting an element with a priority, and extracting the element with the highest priority. In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) `priority_queue` to implement a priority queue efficiently. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define a priority queue of integers
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Print the elements of the priority queue
    cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 50 30 20 10
```

By default, `priority_queue` is implemented as a max heap, where the element with the highest value is at the top. If you want to use a min heap instead, where the element with the lowest value is at the top, you can define your priority queue like this:

```cpp
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
```

Here's a breakdown of the template parameters:

* `int`: The data type of the elements.
* `vector<int>`: The underlying container used to store the elements. In this case, a vector is used, but you can also use other containers like `deque`.
* `greater<int>`: The comparison function used to determine the priority. `greater<int>` creates a min heap, while the default `less<int>` creates a max heap.

You can also customize the priority queue by providing your own comparison function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Different Algorithms

Certainly! Priority queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to manage a collection of elements with associated priorities. They are particularly useful when you need to retrieve elements in order of priority rather than in the order they were inserted. In C++, you typically implement priority queues using the `std::priority_queue` container from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Here are some common algorithms and operations involving priority queues:

1. **Insertion**: Adding an element with a priority to the priority queue. This operation typically has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

2. **Extraction**: Removing and returning the element with the highest priority (or lowest priority, depending on the implementation). This operation also has a time complexity of O(log n).

3. **Heapify**: Converting an array of elements into a heap structure. This operation can be done in linear time, O(n), using algorithms such as heapify or build_heap.

4. **Merging**: Combining two priority queues into one. This operation generally requires merging the underlying heaps, which can be done in O(n) time.

5. **Changing Priority**: Modifying the priority of an element already in the priority queue. This operation can be tricky and often involves removing the element and re-inserting it with the new priority, which can take O(n) time in the worst case.

6. **Top k Elements**: Retrieving the top k elements with the highest (or lowest) priority. This can be done by extracting elements one by one until you have the desired number.

7. **Heap Sort**: Using a priority queue to sort elements. You can insert all elements into the priority queue and then extract them one by one, which sorts them in the desired order. This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n).

8. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A famous graph traversal algorithm that uses a priority queue to greedily select the next vertex to explore based on the shortest known distance. This algorithm is commonly used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

9. **Prim's Algorithm**: Another graph algorithm similar to Dijkstra's, but used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It also utilizes a priority queue to greedily select the next edge to include in the tree.

These are just a few examples of algorithms and operations involving priority queues. They are incredibly versatile and have applications in various fields, including operating systems, networking, and computational biology, among others.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Immutable and Concurrent Collections

In C++, implementing immutable and concurrent priority queues can be a bit challenging due to the language's lack of built-in support for immutability and concurrency. However, it's definitely achievable with some effort and careful design.

#### Immutable Priority Queue

An immutable data structure doesn't allow modification of its contents after creation. You can implement an immutable priority queue by ensuring that all operations return a new priority queue object instead of modifying the existing one. You can do this by using copy-on-write techniques or persistent data structures.

Here's a basic outline of how you might implement an immutable priority queue in C++:

```cpp
template<typename T, typename Compare = std::less<T>>
class ImmutablePriorityQueue {
private:
    std::priority_queue<T, std::vector<T>, Compare> data;

public:
    ImmutablePriorityQueue() = default;

    ImmutablePriorityQueue(std::initializer_list<T> init) : data(init) {}

    ImmutablePriorityQueue push(const T& value) const {
        ImmutablePriorityQueue<T, Compare> newQueue(*this);
        newQueue.data.push(value);
        return newQueue;
    }

    ImmutablePriorityQueue pop() const {
        ImmutablePriorityQueue<T, Compare> newQueue(*this);
        newQueue.data.pop();
        return newQueue;
    }

    const T& top() const {
        return data.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        return data.empty();
    }

    // Other methods like size(), clear(), etc.
};
```

#### Concurrent Priority Queue

Implementing a concurrent priority queue requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety. You can use mutexes or atomic operations to achieve this. Here's a basic example using mutexes:

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

template<typename T, typename Compare = std::less<T>>
class ConcurrentPriorityQueue {
private:
    std::priority_queue<T, std::vector<T>, Compare> data;
    mutable std::mutex mutex;
    std::condition_variable cv;

public:
    ConcurrentPriorityQueue() = default;

    void push(const T& value) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        data.push(value);
        cv.notify_one();
    }

    T pop() {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        cv.wait(lock, [this] { return !data.empty(); });
        T value = data.top();
        data.pop();
        return value;
    }

    const T& top() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        return data.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        return data.empty();
    }

    // Other methods like size(), clear(), etc.
};
```

This implementation uses a mutex to guard access to the underlying data structure, ensuring that only one thread can modify it at a time. The condition variable (`cv`) is used to signal waiting threads when the queue is not empty, allowing them to proceed.

Keep in mind that these implementations are basic and may need enhancements depending on your specific requirements, especially for concurrent data structures where correctness and performance are critical. Also, consider using existing libraries like Intel TBB or Boost for more robust concurrent data structures if they fit your project requirements.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Implementation - Insert

Certainly! A priority queue is a data structure similar to a regular queue or stack data structure, but with each element assigned a priority. In C++, you can implement a priority queue using a variety of underlying data structures, such as a heap. Here's a basic implementation of a priority queue using a binary heap:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<int> heap;

    // Helper function to maintain heap property after insertion
    void heapifyUp(int index) {
        int parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        while (index > 0 && heap[index] > heap[parent]) {
            swap(heap[index], heap[parent]);
            index = parent;
            parent = (index - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

public:
    // Constructor
    PriorityQueue() {}

    // Insert element into the priority queue
    void insert(int value) {
        heap.push_back(value);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    // Utility function to print the priority queue
    void print() {
        for (int i = 0; i < heap.size(); ++i) {
            cout << heap[i] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueue pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.insert(10);
    pq.insert(20);
    pq.insert(15);
    pq.insert(30);
    pq.insert(5);

    // Print the priority queue
    pq.print();

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

* We use a `vector` to store the elements of the priority queue. This allows us to easily resize the underlying array as needed.
* The `heapifyUp` function is used to maintain the heap property after inserting an element into the priority queue. It compares the inserted element with its parent and swaps them if necessary to restore the heap property.
* The `insert` function inserts a new element into the priority queue by appending it to the end of the `vector` and then calling `heapifyUp` to restore the heap property.
* The `print` function is a utility function to print the elements of the priority queue.

You can run this code to see how elements are inserted into the priority queue and how the heap property is maintained.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Insert

Certainly! In C++, you can use the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue. To insert elements into a priority queue, you typically use the `push()` member function.

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to insert elements into a `priority_queue`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Define a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);

    // Display the elements of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* We include the necessary headers (`iostream` and `queue`).
* We declare a priority queue `pq` of integers.
* We insert elements into the priority queue using the `push()` member function.
* Finally, we display the elements of the priority queue by repeatedly popping elements using `top()` to get the highest priority element and `pop()` to remove it.

This code will output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 30 20 10
```

This demonstrates that the priority queue maintains the elements in descending order based on their priority.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Insert Function

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). The `priority_queue` is implemented as a heap, which allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of the maximum (or minimum) element.

Here's how you can implement the insert function for a priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Function to insert an element into the priority queue
template<typename T>
void insertIntoPriorityQueue(priority_queue<T>& pq, const T& element) {
    pq.push(element);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    priority_queue<int> pq; // Creating a priority queue of integers

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 10);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 5);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 20);
    insertIntoPriorityQueue(pq, 15);

    // Printing elements of the priority queue
    cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* We define a function `insertIntoPriorityQueue` that takes a reference to a `priority_queue` and the element to be inserted.
* Inside the function, we simply use the `push` function of the `priority_queue` to insert the element.
* In the `main` function, we create a `priority_queue` of integers and insert some elements into it using the `insertIntoPriorityQueue` function.
* Finally, we print the elements of the priority queue by repeatedly popping elements from it.

This demonstrates the basic usage of inserting elements into a priority queue in C++.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Nearby Cars

Using a priority queue in C++ for managing nearby cars is a common scenario, especially in applications like ride-sharing services or autonomous vehicle navigation systems. The priority queue can be used to efficiently retrieve the nearest cars based on their distance from a given location. Here's a basic implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Define a structure to represent a car
struct Car {
    int id;
    double x, y; // Coordinates of the car
    // Constructor
    Car(int _id, double _x, double _y) : id(_id), x(_x), y(_y) {}
    // Function to calculate distance between two cars
    double distance(const Car& other) const {
        return sqrt(pow(x - other.x, 2) + pow(y - other.y, 2));
    }
};

// Custom comparator for comparing cars based on their distance from a given location
struct CompareCars {
    Car reference_point;
    CompareCars(const Car& ref) : reference_point(ref) {}
    bool operator()(const Car& a, const Car& b) const {
        return a.distance(reference_point) > b.distance(reference_point);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Define the reference point
    Car reference_point(0, 0, 0); // Assuming reference point is at (0, 0)

    // Priority queue of cars, ordered by distance from the reference point
    priority_queue<Car, vector<Car>, CompareCars> nearby_cars(CompareCars(reference_point));

    // Adding some cars to the priority queue
    nearby_cars.push(Car(1, 3, 4));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(2, -1, 2));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(3, 5, 1));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(4, -2, -3));
    nearby_cars.push(Car(5, 0, 0));

    // Retrieve the nearest car
    Car nearest_car = nearby_cars.top();
    cout << "Nearest car ID: " << nearest_car.id << ", Distance: " << nearest_car.distance(reference_point) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation:

* We define a `Car` structure to represent each car, storing its ID and coordinates (x, y).
* We define a custom comparator `CompareCars` to compare cars based on their distance from a reference point.
* We use a priority queue of cars, with the custom comparator `CompareCars`, to store nearby cars ordered by their distance from the reference point.
* We add some cars to the priority queue and retrieve the nearest car using the `top()` function of the priority queue.

You can adapt this code to your specific requirements, such as using real-time location updates for cars or integrating it into a larger application.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Reduced array size to half

Reducing the size of a priority queue (or any dynamic array-based data structure) to half its capacity typically involves creating a new array with half the size and copying elements from the old array to the new one. In C++, you can achieve this by using dynamic memory allocation and the `std::copy` algorithm. Here's a basic example of how you might implement this operation for a priority queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm> // for std::copy

template <typename T>
class PriorityQueue {
private:
    T* array;
    size_t capacity;
    size_t size;

    void resize(size_t newCapacity) {
        T* newArray = new T[newCapacity];
        std::copy(array, array + size, newArray);
        delete[] array;
        array = newArray;
        capacity = newCapacity;
    }

public:
    PriorityQueue() : array(nullptr), capacity(0), size(0) {}

    void push(const T& value) {
        // Check if resize is needed before pushing
        if (size + 1 > capacity) {
            resize(capacity == 0 ? 1 : capacity * 2);
        }
        // Push value into the priority queue
        // (not implemented in this example)
    }

    void pop() {
        // Pop the top element from the priority queue
        // (not implemented in this example)
    }

    // Other member functions...

    ~PriorityQueue() {
        delete[] array;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage
    PriorityQueue<int> pq;
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(3);
    pq.push(8);
    // Perform some operations...

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

* The `resize` function doubles the capacity of the array when needed.
* The `push` function checks if the array needs resizing before adding an element.
* `std::copy` is used to copy elements from the old array to the new array during resizing.
* The destructor deallocates the dynamically allocated memory.

This is a basic implementation. Depending on your requirements, you might need additional functionalities like popping elements, peeking at the top element, or comparing elements for ordering.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Relative Ranks

Sure, I can help you with that! A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element. In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `std::priority_queue` container from the `<queue>` header.

To assign relative ranks to elements in a priority queue, you typically need to perform some operations when inserting elements or when retrieving them. Here's how you could implement a priority queue with relative ranks in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to assign relative ranks to elements
vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Create a copy of nums to keep track of original positions
    vector<int> sorted_nums = nums;
    sort(sorted_nums.rbegin(), sorted_nums.rend()); // Sort in descending order

    // Map to store the original position of each number
    unordered_map<int, int> position_map;
    for (int i = 0; i < sorted_nums.size(); ++i) {
        position_map[sorted_nums[i]] = i + 1;
    }

    // Vector to store result ranks
    vector<string> result(nums.size());

    // Assign ranks
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        int rank = position_map[nums[i]];
        if (rank == 1)
            result[i] = "Gold Medal";
        else if (rank == 2)
            result[i] = "Silver Medal";
        else if (rank == 3)
            result[i] = "Bronze Medal";
        else
            result[i] = to_string(rank);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {10, 3, 8, 9, 4};
    vector<string> ranks = findRelativeRanks(nums);
    
    cout << "Relative Ranks:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        cout << nums[i] << ": " << ranks[i] << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `findRelativeRanks` function takes a vector of integers `nums` as input and returns a vector of strings representing the relative ranks of the numbers. The ranks are assigned based on the sorted order of the numbers. The function first creates a sorted copy of the input vector and then creates a map to store the original position of each number in the sorted order. Then, it iterates through the input vector, looks up the rank of each number in the map, and assigns the appropriate rank string to the result vector. Finally, the main function demonstrates the usage of this function.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Min & Complexity Analysis

In C++, removing the minimum element from a priority queue can be achieved using the `pop()` method. The `pop()` method removes the top element from the priority queue, which is the minimum (or maximum, depending on how you've configured the priority queue).

Here's a simple example of how you can remove the minimum element from a priority queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Insert some elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(15);

    // Remove the minimum element
    pq.pop();

    // Now the top element should be the next minimum
    std::cout << "Minimum element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In terms of complexity analysis:

* Removing the minimum element from a priority queue implemented with a binary heap (the most common implementation) has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue. This is because removing the minimum element involves rearranging the heap to maintain its heap property, which requires logarithmic time relative to the number of elements.

* The space complexity of removing the minimum element from a priority queue is O(1) because the operation doesn't require additional space proportional to the input size. The space complexity of the priority queue itself depends on its implementation, but typically it's O(n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Min Solution & Complexity Analysis

Certainly! In C++, the `priority_queue` container from the Standard Template Library (STL) can be utilized to implement a priority queue. However, it doesn't provide a direct method to remove the minimum element. Instead, we typically simulate removal by accessing the top element (minimum element), popping it, and then reconstructing the priority queue without that element. Let's write a function to remove the minimum element from a `priority_queue` and analyze its complexity.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Function to remove the minimum element from a priority queue
template <typename T>
void removeMin(priority_queue<T>& pq) {
    // Create a temporary priority queue to hold elements
    priority_queue<T> temp;
    
    // Pop the top element (minimum element)
    pq.pop();
    
    // Transfer elements from original pq to temp, excluding the removed element
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        temp.push(pq.top());
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    // Transfer elements back to original pq from temp
    while (!temp.empty()) {
        pq.push(temp.top());
        temp.pop();
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    priority_queue<int> pq;
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(2);
    pq.push(7);
    pq.push(1);
    
    cout << "Before removal: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    // Restore elements and remove minimum
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(2);
    pq.push(7);
    pq.push(1);
    removeMin(pq);
    
    cout << "After removal: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This function `removeMin()` works as follows:

1. It pops the top (minimum) element from the priority queue.
2. It then transfers the remaining elements from the original priority queue to a temporary one, effectively excluding the removed minimum element.
3. After that, it transfers the elements back to the original priority queue from the temporary one.

Let's analyze the time complexity of this `removeMin()` function:

* Popping the top element from a priority queue takes O(log n) time complexity.
* Transferring elements from one priority queue to another takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

So, the overall time complexity of the `removeMin()` function is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the priority queue.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Remove Minimum

In C++, you can implement a priority queue using the `priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). However, `priority_queue` doesn't have a direct method to remove the minimum element. Typically, you would remove the top element, which is the minimum by default.

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use `priority_queue` and remove the minimum element:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(15);
    pq.push(5);

    // Printing the elements of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Priority Queue elements: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop(); // Removing the top element (minimum)
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output:

```bash
Priority Queue elements: 20 15 10 5
```

As you can see, the elements are printed in descending order because `priority_queue` is a max-heap by default. If you want to use a min-heap, you can specify the comparison function.

If you need to remove a specific minimum element, you might consider using a different data structure such as a set or a multiset, where you can iterate through and remove specific elements based on your criteria.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm used to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit. It's an efficient way to find primes and is based on the principle of iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. Here's how you can implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes using C++ with a priority queue:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void sieveOfEratosthenes(int n) {
    // Create a boolean vector "prime[0..n]" and initialize
    // all entries as true.
    vector<bool> prime(n + 1, true);

    // Create a priority queue to store the primes.
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; ++p) {
        // If prime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime
        if (prime[p] == true) {
            // Update all multiples of p
            for (int i = p * p; i <= n; i += p)
                prime[i] = false;
        }
    }

    // Store primes in the priority queue
    for (int p = 2; p <= n; ++p)
        if (prime[p])
            pq.push(p);

    // Print the primes in ascending order
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the upper limit for prime numbers: ";
    cin >> n;

    cout << "Prime numbers up to " << n << " are:\n";
    sieveOfEratosthenes(n);

    return 0;
}
```

This C++ code uses a boolean vector `prime` to mark whether a number is prime or not. It iterates through the numbers, marking multiples of each prime number as not prime. Finally, it stores the primes found in a priority queue and prints them out in ascending order.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queue: Weakest Rows

To implement a priority queue for the "Weakest Rows" problem, you'll need a way to prioritize rows based on their strength. In this problem, the strength of a row is defined as the number of soldiers in it. We can use a min-heap to store pairs of (strength, index), where strength is the number of soldiers and index is the row index. This way, when we pop from the priority queue, we'll get the row with the weakest soldiers first.

Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

vector<int> kWeakestRows(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    // Priority queue to store pairs of (strength, index)
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    
    // Iterate through each row, calculate strength and push into the priority queue
    for (int i = 0; i < mat.size(); ++i) {
        int strength = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].size(); ++j) {
            strength += mat[i][j];
        }
        pq.push({strength, i});
    }
    
    // Extract the k weakest rows from the priority queue
    vector<int> result;
    while (k-- > 0 && !pq.empty()) {
        result.push_back(pq.top().second);
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
        {1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
    };
    int k = 3;
    
    vector<int> weakest = kWeakestRows(mat, k);
    
    cout << "The indices of the k weakest rows are: ";
    for (int idx : weakest) {
        cout << idx << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we first iterate through each row of the matrix, calculate its strength (i.e., the sum of elements), and push a pair of (strength, index) into the priority queue. Then, we pop the k weakest rows from the priority queue and return their indices.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues

Priority queues are a fundamental data structure in computer science, used to maintain a set of elements with associated priorities. They are often implemented as heaps due to their efficient insertion and removal operations.

In C++, you can use the `std::priority_queue` container provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement a priority queue. Here's a basic overview of how to use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Declaration of priority queue
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Printing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Printing the top element after removal
    std::cout << "Top element after removal: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Checking if the priority queue is empty
    if (pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is empty.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Priority queue is not empty.\n";
    }

    // Size of the priority queue
    std::cout << "Size of priority queue: " << pq.size() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::priority_queue<int>` creates a priority queue of integers. You can change `int` to any other data type or define your own custom comparison function if you need to prioritize elements differently.

Key operations include:

* `push(value)`: Inserts an element into the priority queue.
* `pop()`: Removes the top element from the priority queue.
* `top()`: Accesses the top (highest priority) element in the priority queue.
* `empty()`: Checks if the priority queue is empty.
* `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the priority queue.

Priority queues are often used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and Huffman coding. They provide efficient access to the element with the highest priority, making them indispensable in many applications.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues (Heaps)

Priority queues are essential data structures in computer science, particularly for scenarios where elements need to be processed based on their priority. Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues efficiently. Here's a brief overview of priority queues and heaps in the context of C++:

#### Priority Queues

* **Definition**: A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack, but each element has an associated priority. Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.
  
* **Operations**:
  * **Insertion**: Adds an element with a priority to the queue.
  * **Deletion**: Removes the element with the highest priority from the queue.
  * **Peek**: Returns the element with the highest priority without removing it from the queue.
  
* **Implementation**: Priority queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, binary heaps, or balanced binary search trees. Binary heaps are one of the most common implementations due to their efficiency.

#### Heaps

* **Definition**: A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min heap, the value of the node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
  
* **Operations**:
  * **Insertion**: Adds a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
  * **Deletion**: Removes the root node (the maximum or minimum value) from the heap and restores the heap property.
  * **Heapify**: Converts an array of elements into a heap.
  
* **Implementation**: Heaps are commonly implemented using arrays due to their compact representation. In a binary heap, the parent of the node at index \(i\) is at index \((i-1)/2\), and its children are at indices \(2i+1\) and \(2i+2\).

#### C++ Implementation

C++ provides the `priority_queue` container adapter in the `<queue>` header, which implements a priority queue using a heap by default. You can also implement heaps from scratch using arrays or dynamic memory allocation.

Here's an example of using `priority_queue` in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;
    
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(20);
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << " ";
        pq.pop();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This would output: `30 20 10`.

For more control or specific requirements, you may need to implement your heap or priority queue from scratch, especially if you need to customize the behavior or performance characteristics.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): Priority Queues & Heaps

Priority queues and heaps are fundamental data structures used in computer science and algorithm design, particularly for tasks that require efficient prioritization or ordering of elements. In C++, you can implement priority queues using the standard library's `priority_queue` container, which internally uses a heap data structure.

Here's an overview of priority queues and heaps in C++:

#### Priority Queues

A priority queue is a type of container in which elements are popped based on their priority. Elements with higher priority are popped before elements with lower priority. Priority queues typically support operations like insertion and deletion of elements, as well as retrieval of the highest-priority element without removing it.

In C++, you can use the `priority_queue` container provided by the `<queue>` header.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(20);
    pq.push(5);

    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    pq.pop();
    std::cout << "Top element after popping: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Heaps

A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children, and in a min heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its children. Heaps are often implemented as arrays, where the parent-child relationships are determined by the indices of the array elements.

In C++, the `priority_queue` container typically uses a max heap, but you can implement your own heap data structure if you need more control.

**Example of a Max Heap:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void heapify(std::vector<int>& arr, int n, int i) {
    int largest = i;
    int left = 2 * i + 1;
    int right = 2 * i + 2;

    if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
        largest = left;

    if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
        largest = right;

    if (largest != i) {
        std::swap(arr[i], arr[largest]);
        heapify(arr, n, largest);
    }
}

void buildMaxHeap(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        heapify(arr, n, i);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
    buildMaxHeap(arr);

    std::cout << "Max Heap: ";
    for (int num : arr)
        std::cout << num << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates building a max heap from an array. You can modify it for a min heap by changing the comparison logic.

Understanding priority queues and heaps is essential for various algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, and efficient sorting algorithms like heap sort. They offer efficient insertion and removal of elements based on their priority, making them invaluable tools in algorithm design and optimization.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: array representation

In C++, priority queues are typically implemented using heaps, particularly binary heaps. Binary heaps can be easily represented using arrays. Here's a basic explanation of how to represent a priority queue using an array in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class PriorityQueue {
private:
    vector<int> heap;

    // Helper functions
    int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; }
    int leftChild(int i) { return (2 * i) + 1; }
    int rightChild(int i) { return (2 * i) + 2; }

    // Rearranges elements to maintain heap property
    void heapifyUp(int i) {
        while (i > 0 && heap[parent(i)] < heap[i]) {
            swap(heap[parent(i)], heap[i]);
            i = parent(i);
        }
    }

    // Rearranges elements to maintain heap property
    void heapifyDown(int i) {
        int maxIndex = i;
        int left = leftChild(i);
        int right = rightChild(i);

        if (left < heap.size() && heap[left] > heap[maxIndex]) {
            maxIndex = left;
        }

        if (right < heap.size() && heap[right] > heap[maxIndex]) {
            maxIndex = right;
        }

        if (i != maxIndex) {
            swap(heap[i], heap[maxIndex]);
            heapifyDown(maxIndex);
        }
    }

public:
    // Inserts a new element into the priority queue
    void insert(int value) {
        heap.push_back(value);
        heapifyUp(heap.size() - 1);
    }

    // Removes and returns the maximum element (root) from the priority queue
    int extractMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }

        int maxElement = heap[0];
        heap[0] = heap.back();
        heap.pop_back();
        heapifyDown(0);
        return maxElement;
    }

    // Returns the maximum element (root) from the priority queue without removing it
    int getMax() {
        if (heap.empty()) {
            throw out_of_range("Priority queue is empty");
        }
        return heap[0];
    }

    // Returns true if the priority queue is empty, false otherwise
    bool isEmpty() {
        return heap.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueue pq;
    pq.insert(10);
    pq.insert(20);
    pq.insert(15);
    pq.insert(30);

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        cout << pq.extractMax() << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a basic implementation of a priority queue using a max-heap. The `PriorityQueue` class uses a vector to store elements, where each element is inserted into the appropriate position in the heap according to its priority. The `insert()` function inserts a new element into the heap while maintaining the heap property, the `extractMax()` function removes and returns the maximum element from the heap, and the `getMax()` function returns the maximum element without removing it.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: basics

Sure, let's dive into the basics of priority queues in C++.

A priority queue is a data structure that manages a set of elements with priorities. The elements are stored in such a way that the element with the highest (or lowest) priority can be accessed quickly. Priority queues are commonly implemented using heaps, which are specialized binary trees.

In C++, the standard library provides the `priority_queue` class, which is a part of the `<queue>` header file. Here's how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a priority queue of integers, inserts some elements into it, accesses the top element, removes the top element, and then accesses the new top element.

By default, the `priority_queue` is a max heap, which means the element with the highest value will be at the top. If you want to create a min heap (where the smallest element is at the top), you can specify a custom comparator function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Custom comparator function for min heap
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(int a, int b) {
        return a > b; // Returns true if a should go before b in the priority queue
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating a priority queue of integers with custom comparator
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, Compare> pq;

    // Inserting elements into the priority queue
    pq.push(30);
    pq.push(10);
    pq.push(50);
    pq.push(20);

    // Accessing the top element (highest priority)
    std::cout << "Top element: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    // Removing the top element
    pq.pop();

    // Accessing the new top element
    std::cout << "Top element after pop: " << pq.top() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `Compare` is a struct defining the custom comparator function. The function returns true if `a` should go before `b` in the priority queue, effectively creating a min heap.

That's the basics of priority queues in C++ using the standard library. They are quite handy for tasks where you need to process elements in order of priority.

### 1. Algorithms & Data Structures (C++): priority queues: remove operation

In C++, priority queues don't typically support a direct remove operation like standard containers such as vectors or sets. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using other data structures in combination with the priority queue.

One common approach is to use an additional data structure, like a map or a set, to keep track of the elements' positions in the priority queue. Here's a simple example using a map:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

template<typename T>
class PriorityQueueWithRemove {
private:
    priority_queue<T> pq;
    unordered_map<T, int> index; // Maps element to its index in the priority queue

public:
    void push(const T& val) {
        pq.push(val);
        index[val] = pq.size(); // Index is 1-based
    }

    void remove(const T& val) {
        if (index.find(val) == index.end()) return; // Element not found

        int idx = index[val];
        index.erase(val);

        // Swap with the last element and pop
        if (idx != pq.size()) {
            T last = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(last);
            index[last] = idx;
        }
        pq.pop(); // Remove the duplicated last element
    }

    T top() const {
        return pq.top();
    }

    bool empty() const {
        return pq.empty();
    }

    size_t size() const {
        return pq.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    PriorityQueueWithRemove<int> pq;
    pq.push(3);
    pq.push(5);
    pq.push(1);
    pq.push(7);

    cout << "Current top: " << pq.top() << endl; // Should print 7

    pq.remove(5); // Remove element 5

    cout << "After removal, new top: " << pq.top() << endl; // Should print 7

    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, the `index` map keeps track of the index of each element in the priority queue. When removing an element, it swaps the element with the last one in the queue and then pops it. This approach allows for a pseudo-removal operation with logarithmic complexity. Keep in mind that the actual removal might not be very efficient compared to direct removal in other data structures.
